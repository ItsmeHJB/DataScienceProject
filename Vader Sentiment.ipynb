comments.ethan and alex were married under the covered bridge at the indiana state fairground. who knew there were fabulous places to get married at the fairgrounds?.i had a lot of fun getting to know alex over coffee with her mother at starbucks over a year before the wedding. alex said that she and ethan were passionate about their dog \"slink\" and harry potter. i got so excited about harry potter. my husband and i have had so much fun with harry over the years. listening and reading sessions and having fun with the absolute belief that magic is real!.i\\'d been waiting for the opportunity to write a harry potter wedding ceremony script and alex was all over it!! i was able to work slink into this wedding too!.the wedding was absolutely wonderful. ethan and alex were both in tears exchanging their wedding vows and everyone has so much fun with the whole ceremony! you can also view another unbreakable vow wedding ceremony i wrote here..ethan and alex make their unbreakable vow.ladies and gentlemen  thank you for joining us today. please silence your phones and refrain from taking pictures during the ceremony. thank you..welcome.welcome! we are gathered here today to celebrate and to witness the joining of alex and ethan in marriage. as they promise to love  trust in that love .honor one another as individuals  and anticipate with joy spending the rest of their lives together. they  are surrounded by you - their friends and family. thank you for gathering here to witness their marriage and to share in the joy of this special occasion..moment of silence.we’d like to take a moment to remember those who are not with us here today. either those who couldn’t be here today or who are no longer with us. we know that they are here with us in spirit.alex and ethan  today  as you two are joined in marriage  there is a vast and unknown future stretching out before you. the possibilities and potentials of your married life are great. we join with you in hoping you make real your dreams! that you are reborn in each other as you share your loves and dreams  wants and desires and together are enriched by them. through your commitment to each other  may you grow and nurture a love that makes both of you better people  a love that continues to give you great joy  and also a passion for living that provides you with energy and patience to face the responsibilities of life. there was a time when your lives were two separate paths. gradually  they were joined as you grew closer together. today  you proclaim to the world your choice to stay on the same path together. may you be enriched by the unique view of the other!.i know there was a lot of discussion as to whether or not slink  the wonder dog was going to be here today. he’s such an important part of your lives. that’s why  i think this reading is perfect for today. we all learn from each other and we can learn a lot from dogs!.how falling in love is like owning a dog.by taylor mali.first of all  it’s a big responsibility  owning a dog or falling in love....so think long and hard before deciding on love..on the other hand  love gives you a sense of security:.when you’re walking down the street late at night.and you have a leash on love.ain’t nobody going to mess with you..because crooks and muggers think love is unpredictable..who knows what love could do in its own defense?.on cold winter nights  love is warm..it lies between you and lives and breathes.and makes funny noises..love wakes you up all hours of the night with its needs..it needs to be fed so it will grow and stay healthy..love doesn’t like being left alone for long..but come home and love is always happy to see you..it may break a few things accidentally in its passion for life .but you can never be mad at love for long..is love good all the time? no! no!.love can be bad. bad  love  bad! very bad love..love makes messes..love leaves you little surprises here and there..love needs lots of cleaning up after..sometimes you just want to get love fixed..sometimes you want to roll up a piece of newspaper.and swat love on the nose .not so much to cause pain .just to let love know don’t you ever do that again!.sometimes love just wants to go out for a nice long walk..because love loves exercise. it will run you around the block.and leave you panting  breathless. pull you in different directions.at once  or wind itself around and around you.until you’re all wound up and you cannot move..but love makes you meet people wherever you go..people who have nothing in common but love.stop and talk to each other on the street..throw things away and love will bring them back .again  and again  and again..but most of all  love needs love  lots of it..and in return  love loves you and never stops..now  i don’t think that two big harry potter fans  like ethan and alex  could think about getting married without making the unbreakable vow and declaring until avada kedavera do us part! to you muggles that are unfamiliar with the magical lingo  the unbreakable vow is when you make a vow in such seriousness  if you should break the vow  you will die. on the other hand  avada kedavera is the killing curse! oh  to think that nothing could ever separate you other than a killing curse in a duel!.there are a few things we can learn about love and marriage from the magical world of harry potter….albus dumbledore said “we can’t choose our fate but we can choose others ” he also goes on to say that we should “be careful in knowing that.” we know that you have made a very careful choice in deciding to get married today  and you have chosen each other  knowing that whatever fate might bring  the two of you  together  know that you can face it..there may be things you face over the lifetime of your marriage that seem insurmountable  like a 12 foot mountain troll. but remember this potter quote  “there are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a 12 foot mountain troll is one of them.” remember when you face the mountain trolls of life  you will find out things about yourselves and each other  that you would have never seen  had you not been put to the test. good things like strength and wit  and of course  cleverness  bravery and friendship..perhaps the best vows to make today is what james potter declared when he said “until the very end.” the interesting thing about that quote is that james potter said it from beyond the grave. so  with that  may your vow today be beyond the typical “until death do us part.” may your love always connect you on a level beyond our physical understanding knowing that is where the actual magic is..dumbledore declared  “let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress  adventure.” we hope your marriage is full of adventure!.along your adventure  listen to ron who said  “when in doubt  go to the library.”.when things get challenging  remember dumbledore also said  “time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead.” but i hope you have a helpful marauders map to show you what’s along the way when you need it. and may you also know when it’s exactly the right time to say “mischief managed!”.remember that your marriage will take on a life of it’s own and your relationship will grow. “it matters not what someone is born  it’s what they grow to be” your marriage starts today  it’s born today  you can control what it grows to be by your choices and actions. “what’s comin’ will come and we’ll meet it when it does.”.know that  “happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn the light on.”.slughorn said  “it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love.” love  simply is  you can choose to let it flow through you or not. love is the power behind the magic..in the end  remember  “you are protected  in short  by your ability to love.” and when someone asks  “even after all this time?” may your answer be  “always.”.vows.do you ethan  take alex  to be your wife  to have and to hold from this day forward  for better or for worse  for richer  for poorer  in sickness and in health  to love and to cherish; from this day forward through all your adventures in life together?.do you alex take ethan  to be your husband  to have and to hold from this day forward  for better or for worse  for richer  for poorer  in sickness and in health  to love and to cherish; from this day forward through all of your adventures in life together..alex and ethan would now like to share their own vows here.ring exchange.\\u200b.the rings are the universal symbols of marriage. they mean many things. from now on you will wear these rings and they will remind you... they will remind you of the endless circle that they are. like love  there is no beginning and no end. they will remind you daily that you are married. sometimes they will remind you of the commitment that you have made - for better or worse. but  may they always remind you that there is one other person in the world that has pledged to love you forever  through thick and through thin and with all that they have..alex  i give you this ring with all that i am and all that i ever will be. wear it and know that i love you. with this ring  i marry you..ethan  i give you this ring with all that i am and all that i ever will be. wear it and know that i love you. with this ring  i marry you..the hand ceremony.and now as you are holding hands take a moment  so that you may see the gift that you are to each other..these are the hands of your best friend  young and strong and full of love for you  that are holding yours on your wedding day as you promise to love each other today  tomorrow and forever..these are the hands that will work alongside yours as together you build your future..these are the hands that will countless times wipe the tears from your eyes  tears of sorrow and tears of joy..these are the hands that will give you support and encouragement to chase down your dreams..these are the hands that will give you strength when you need it..these are the hands that will lift your chin and brush your cheek as they raise your face to look into eyes that are filled with overwhelming love for you..and lastly  these are the hands that even when wrinkled and aged will still be reaching for yours  still giving you the same unspoken tenderness with just a touch..final blessing.alex and ethan  may all your days be blessed with love and friendship. may each day and night of your lives be a new beginning..may your home be filled with laughter and the warm embrace of a summer’s day..may you find peacefulness and beauty  challenge  and satisfaction  humor and insight  healing and renewal  love and wisdom  as in a quiet heart..may you always feel that what you have is enough..the pronouncement.it is my great pleasure to acknowledge your union as “husband and wife.”.you may now seal your marriage with a kiss!!!.ladies and gentlemen  it is my pleasure to introduce to you mr. and mrs....0 comments.leave a reply..as a wedding officiant  i want every couple to the the wedding ceremony they want. since i
