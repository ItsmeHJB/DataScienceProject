love is the foundation of our relationships and trust is a building block. louie knows i love him and that i’m in charge. who knew i had to learn to be an alpha dog! we’ll talk about that next time!.* 1 corinthians 13.click the image for information on how to order louie’s leadership lessons.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  courage  honesty  leadership  trust leave a comment post navigation.envy–a very deadly sin.step up and be a leader.leave a comment cancel reply.comment.name email website.notify me of follow-up comments by email..notify me of new posts by email..this site uses akismet to reduce spam. learn how your comment data is processed..subscribe to blog via email.enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email..email address	.search for:.recent posts.time to say goodbye may 22  2020.when the world was silent may 14  2020.back to normal? no  thank you!

dog trainer,transparency – page 3 – unleash love.skip to content	.menu	.lead like louie blog.eradicating bullying from the classroom to the boardroom.transparency	.life interrupted.june 26  2017 january 10  2017 by danisedistasi.today was the first day i was able to wrap my arms around louie and give him a huge bear hug. it was three weeks ago that i had an accident and our lives quickly changed. and in celebrating my ability to hug him and receive an under the neck snuggle from him  i thought it fitting to resume our blog after an unintentionally extended vacation..december 18  2016  was filled with great anticipation. it was one week before christmas  and the distasi family was planning to gather at my house to celebrate christmas. everything was set; the massive amounts of food  the decorations  gifts  and music. it was to be a celebration to top all the ones we had celebrated so far as a family..louie and i took our usual stroll early that morning. two days before  there had been a late evening ice storm  but this particular morning seemed okay as far as icy pavement was concerned. still  i was cautious and walked in the grass as much as possible..an elderly neighbor has a very long driveway  and louie and i had been taking her daily newspaper to her so she would not have to venture out and lean over to pick it up. as soon as i stepped on the driveway  my feet flew up in the air  and i landed on my left hip. i lost control of louie  and it took me a few moments to catch my breath. i couldn’t see louie  and panic was about to set in. his normal reaction when something startles him is to run away. and seeing his mama flying through the air had to have been startling..i forced myself to turn as far to the left as i could. there louie sat  close behind my left shoulder. i reached around to draw him close to me. as he tucked his head under my arm  i felt his shaking and heard him whimper. to hear him cry broke my heart  and my tears started to flow uncontrollably. i knew i could not move—and whatever would take place from that moment forward  it would be a long journey. louie chose to stay by me as the faithful friend that he is..a neighbor pulled up with his phone in hand  already calling 911  and i called my friend and neighbor cindy to pick up louie. i called my daughter  marisa  and the network of community  family  and friends jumped into action. everyone’s life was interrupted on december 18  2016..after a jarring ambulance ride  surgery to repair a femur that was fractured in two places  a total hip replacement  five days in the hospital  and physical therapy  i was released to marisa and matt’s home for respite care and to celebrate christmas with the two cutest nurses on the face of the earth. louie had been well taken care of by my wonderful neighbors who had walked him  let him stay in their homes  taken him to daycare to play  and given him more love than he could imagine..life interrupted has taught louie and me a few things:.we appreciate life and the little things: although that seems so cliché  it was the small steps of accomplishment that filled me with joy. every day  i set new goals to accomplish—goals i never would have dreamed to set before. for instance  i learned to get out of bed  to go to the bathroom  and to take my meds without having to wake my daughter to help me. and to carry a cup of coffee in the morning to enjoy my quiet time. mea and evi helped me do things as they watched me improve. christmas had a deeper meaning this year with sincere thankfulness  love  and joy!.you really do know who your friends are: so many people dropped everything to help. it was a terrible strain on marisa and matt as they took care of me. so many friends offered to grocery shop  run errands  and stay with me when i finally came home. my sisters and cousin packed their clothes and took turns staying overnight. my brothers were calling  visiting  and bringing food. the neighbors who took care of louie were such godsends. many people could not help because of logistics  but they checked in and prayed..you have to move out of your comfort zone: this was a tough one for louie and me. i had to let people help me. what a humbling position to be in; i was helpless. i have never stayed in a hospital other than to give birth. i don’t take any medicines  and i have never fractured a single bone. the outpouring of love and encouragement has been overwhelming. louie had to be comfortable with people coming and going in and out of our home and driving him to and from daycare. but we both pressed on through pain  frustration  fear  and being uncomfortable. it was difficult  but i believe we made it past the hardest part of this process. there’s still much more healing to take place and there will always be a next move out of our comfort zone. i have no doubt we’ll press through that too..some things just do not matter: the superficiality of the holidays clashed with the richness of genuine  loving relationships. there can be no comparison of the things that are bought with the things that are sought  caught  and taught. the characteristics of love  joy  and peace are important for us to live and pass on to others. it takes effort  but it is worth the time and effort. i am a better person because of the love  joy  and peace that others shared with me this season..2017 is going to be a great year of love and strength. louie is a better dog because he chose faithfulness over running away. he trusted and allowed others into his world to help us! we are closer because of these last few weeks. thank you to so many for being in my life and for your prayers and support!.click here to sign up for louie’s email list..categories balance of

thought. his friend sammy is a tan and black pug with a unique characteristic: his tongue protrudes ever so slightly. i recognized that the person walking him was not his owner. that’s not unusual since many of us in the community need others to walk our dogs on occasion. louie was excited to see his buddy and could hardly wait to romp and play..as we approached  i asked if the dog was sammy  because he had the same markings and same characteristic of a slightly protruding tongue. the person walking him said no. but louie quickly ran up to the sammy look-alike; it did not take him long to realize this was not his buddy  and then he became indignant as if he was mad at the pug for not being sammy..we quickly said our good-byes while louie kicked up his feet and snarled just to make sure the dog understood he was not even close to being sammy..i realized louie’s expectations for playing with his friend were unmet  and disappointment had set in quickly. based on all appearances  louie was expecting to have fun and play  but that expectation was not to be filled that day..this time of year  the majority of us have many expectations that  when unmet for whatever reason  will disappoint us. people have a hard time moving on from such setbacks. i think these disappointments occur because we’ve set ourselves up for failure when we box up our expectations in the hopes that they will be fulfilled..instead  what if we had a spirit of expectancy? you may wonder what the difference is between having expectations and having a spirit of expectancy. a spirit of expectancy is what very young children usually possess. they have the mindset that something wonderful is about to happen  but with no expectation of specifics. while they may wish for something on their christmas list  it is their heart of expectancy that is truly magical. it is the hopefulness of something wonderful. for me  that may entail time with my family  but without expectation that the time meets any specific criteria—it is simply time together..another example occurred on the holiest of nights. for centuries  people expected the messiah to come amongst their midst. in this expectation  they envisioned a king  surrounded by throngs of noble men and women and trumpets blaring. because of these expectations they missed the wonder of all that took place on that quiet  serene night when the stars were brightly shining..yet only those with a spirit of expectancy  whose hearts were open to the wonder of what only the creator of the universe could put into action  witnessed the birth of the king in a simple  lowly manger..expectations for particular things and events always run the risk of disappointing us  since many times  events and what others do are out of our control. as we wind down our year  rather than focusing on the disappointments of unmet expectations  let’s look forward with a heart of expectancy and see if that doesn’t lighten our spirits with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen..while louie experienced disappointment by not having his expectations met with the look-alike sammy  it did not dampen his spirit of expectancy. he still walks out of our home with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen. something as simple as seeing a dear neighbor who pats him on the head or gives him belly rubs lends to his heart of wonder..click the

don’t want to be!.november 13  2016 november 15  2016 by danisedistasi.louie was not having it. he planted all four paws on the floor and would not move an inch. his face let me know he was not pleased. at all..“louie ” i said sternly as i tried to squeeze his 40 pounds of muscle where it didn’t want to go. “this is only for two hours  if that. surely you can oblige me.”.i sat back and stared at him  exasperated. for the last few halloweens  i’ve donned a cruella de vil look and spent the evening with my grandchildren. this year i thought it would be fun to take louie along in a dalmatian outfit. except there were no dalmatian costumes for dogs. the closest thing i could find was a child’s costume for a spotted cow..i had imagined how it would turn out. louie might not share my enthusiasm for this creative costume. but he’d forget all about it when he set eyes on my granddaughters  evi and mea. he’d jump out of the car and happily trot with them along the street  greeting other children  trying to get a peek into their candy loot. i just knew louie would have more fun than he could imagine if he could just push through wearing a silly cow outfit and look as much like a dalmatian as he could..i also imagined it would make a great blog lesson: all about pressing through uncomfortable situations to enjoy the outcome. sounds good  right?.being someone we’re not.but none of that happened. yes  lou was happy to see evi and mea. he did enjoy it when other children came up to love on him. but he hated his costume and was mad at me the entire time. he wouldn’t even pose for a picture  and believe me  that’s not like him..i finally took the costume off and let him be louie..too often we find ourselves being something we don’t want to be. maybe it’s of our own doing — because we think we need to fit in  and it requires being someone “different.” but often it’s because someone else expects us to be different than what we are..maybe it’s a negative thing: a boss requires us to be something based on their own insecurities. or maybe it’s positive: a leader sees potential in us that we don’t see or can even imagine  and they want to coach us to be better..no matter the reason  we resist because it is uncomfortable to be something we are not. we don’t want to don a costume and fake it..can’t make anyone change.it’s tough to balance being authentic and at the same time develop beyond mediocrity toward excellence. it can feel like donning a facade and “faking it till we make it.” what should leaders do to help folks grow?.if you’re in a position of leadership  you can suggest someone continue to develop. you can provide tools  mentoring  and ongoing training. but you can’t make them be something they don’t want to be. each person is responsible for taking that first step to wanting to make significant changes in their lives..still  there are ways to influence those in whom you see potential. for example:.watch to see whether the person shows an eagerness to learn and grow  i.e.  reading books and asking for help..ask them where do they see themselves going? what is their end goal?.share with them what potential you see in them..be sure your expectations align with their skillset and desires..if their end goal and desires outweigh their skillset  place them on a realistic development plan and be clear about expectations..greater than they imagine.when louie and i arrived back home  he was one tired pup. he slinked upstairs to his little bed to lay down. his expression told me he was still traumatized by the costume. but as i knelt down to give him a kiss  i looked into his eyes and saw a little spark..it was a look that said  “if you are trying to make me be something different than who i am  at least make me a lion!”.and with that  he tucked his head into the fold of his front paw and fell fast asleep. no doubt  that evening he dreamt of being a lion..louie the lion…hear me roar!.categories balance of strong  be authentic

her younger sister  mea. though you may have heard this “tail” a time or two before  i thought you would enjoy this rendition:.“a long time ago  there was a little dog who was all alone in the woods. he was scared and afraid and felt very  very alone. it was nighttime and then daylight and then nighttime  again and again. once  he saw another little animal and thought  ‘oh  that looks like someone who could be my friend.’ but the animal was a mean cat. it hissed and clawed at the poor little dog  scratching his ear till it started to bleed. ‘my ’ said the pup. ‘i guess it doesn’t want to be my friend.’ the little dog still has a mark on his ear..“the poor little dog was sad  but he kept on going because he knew somewhere  someone would love him. he was so tired that he couldn’t keep his head up. he came to a road and a woman who was driving by saw him and picked him up. she took him to a place filled with lots of people and other dogs. the people called and called and called all sorts of places to find out if anyone owned the dog. they put up signs and waited and waited  but no one came to see the little dog. he still felt all alone..“one morning  the people put the little dog in a van and drove him far  far away. they took him to an adopt-a-pet store. there  he saw a nice lady who took him home. he was scared at first  but then the lady opened the door to her home  and two little girls were waiting for him. they hugged him and kissed his head and called him their brother. louie finally found a place he called home and two sisters who loved him very much.”.mea’s mouth dropped open as she squealed  “lou-weeeeee?”.“yep  that’s louie’s story ” evi proudly announced..i smiled as i heard the tale so poignantly shared. once again  louie’s story tugged at my heart as i thought about our little dog wandering the streets and wooded areas  not knowing where he was or where he should go. it is even sadder to think that despite the shelter’s efforts to find his family  no one came to take him home. louie was unclaimed and unloved—a very sad state  indeed..since he first came to live in my home  there has been no question that he is loved. i’ve gladly claimed him as my little pal  and he truly is a brother to evi and mea. he knows where home is. every time we take a walk  he’ll look up at me with those big  brown eyes  and i’ll ask  “do you want to go home  lou?” with a spring in his step and dogged determination  he’ll prance all the way home with little guidance from me. i have been unwavering in working through life’s tough spots to build a relationship of trust  and it has paid off in huge dividends of joy for louie and me as well as for evi  mea  and many other people whom louie has come to know and love..being unclaimed and unloved is not limited to adopted pups. many people in our lives have suffered through this emotional pain. many times  these people are close friends  teammates  bosses  or fellow board members. we never know who they are because  in today’s shallow society  we don’t take the time to learn about people’s lives. we often wonder what is wrong with individuals who act out  but in many cases  these people may be unclaimed and unloved and are looking for others they can trust. don’t be like the cat in louie’s tale and lash out at them..before passing judgment on others  take the time to learn their stories. people are fascinating  and everyone has a unique history. once you learn about someone and take the time to get to know them  you’ll see them blossom and grow. learning about others is imperative to help our team build trust and learn to walk in their strengths. be the leader who is unwavering in working through tough spots to build a relationship of trust. this effort will pay off in huge dividends of joy and—believe it or not—productivity..if you are reading this blog  i want you to know you are not unclaimed or unloved  no matter what has happened to you in your past. god is unwavering in his love for us. it is up to us to joyfully accept and receive such love..as for louie—he has taught me so much about love and determination. i am never without a lesson from this little chap. he has also opened my eyes to that fact that my sweet evi is carrying on the nonna tradition of being the “best story maker” ever. together  she and i gave you a tiny glimpse into what is to come for louie’s leadership lessons. stay tuned for more news on louie’s future in our upcoming blogs..click here to order louie’s leadership lessons.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold

have a very touchy subject to discuss  one that is also a continuing issue. just when i think louie is over this particular behavior  he reverts to square one  and we have to start training all over again..every time someone comes to my door  he has a very strong reaction; he starts barking  growling  and lowering his head—all signs that he is ready to attack  even though he has never attacked anyone. while this is great for all the intruders that come to my door  it can also be annoying since most are guests or delivering expected packages..my guests will walk in  fully expecting an overly excited dog to greet them. i’ve worked with louie to sit and remain seated until i give him a release signal. only then can he approach the guest and smell the person. but the minute i do not enforce this training  he goes right back to his bad behavior..ever since i’ve known louie  he has had only great experiences at my front door. i have welcomed everyone who has entered with hugs  and they love seeing louie. he has never encountered someone breaking in  trying to kidnap me  or causing any commotion whatsoever at the front door. the people he encounters are simply entering my home..i had to ask myself  what would cause this behavior? did he have a bad past experience? is he afraid someone will take him from his cushy environment? does he not want me to give anyone else any attention? none of this made sense..when i share about his behavior with others  everyone says he is just being protective  and i’m left again to ask why. why does he think i need protection? and if i do need it  then shouldn’t he react the same way when we are on a walk and someone approaches me? but he doesn’t. he could care less. in fact  i am sure that if someone with ill intent approached me  he would run in the opposite direction as fast as he could. he doesn’t care if i pet other dogs  and all my neighbors can attest to this behavior—but only outside..inside my house  it’s a different story. over the last three years  i have realized that louie is indeed protecting his territory. given his history  he has a profound need to feel safe and clearly does not want anyone disrupting that. while i appreciate that and want him to feel safe  it annoys me to fight this battle every time someone comes to my door. being territorial is not very becoming and can turn many people away. i have to shake my head and wonder why dogs  especially louie  behave that way. and then it hit me: i am the very same way. i am territorial..for instance  i struggled with sharing the louie leadership model in our last blog because of the thoughts that slowly began to creep into my mind and heart. someone  i thought  will steal it and call it their own (no one ever does that in the training/consulting world  right?) or say they thought of it first. and so on. such thoughts continued to color my excitement about developing and sharing the model and the louie stories that accompanied each step. while i shake my head and ask louie why he acts like he does  i had to ask myself the same question. what benefit is it to anyone if i am territorial and hoard a new idea?.it is humbling to realize that a behavior is very unbecoming. we humans are so often territorial when we think we have a great idea  a unique method  or a new creation. an old expression often brings me back to reality:.there is nothing new under the sun!.louie’s behavior is typical of most dogs. for humans to want to protect their turf is normal. but just because it is “typical” or “normal” behavior does not mean it is acceptable. i shared the louie model because it is a really great model and not mine to hoard. it was gifted to me by the one who blessed me with louie—god. and i believe god wants me to give freely to others the gifts with which he has blessed me..now if i can just get louie to see our home as a gift that we should share with others  we’d be so much better off! we have a lot of work to do!.***********.louie had to say goodbye to his sweet cousin  lily  last week! our family will always have fond memories of her running around the pool  trying to keep everyone in line. in the last

leadership model.september 17  2016 september 16  2016 by danisedistasi.we hope you enjoyed your summer. in celebration of the 3rd anniversary of louie’s adoption  we decided to to do an extended blog  introducing our louie leadership model..our story began three years ago in the rolling hills of boyd county  kentucky—a place i never knew existed. it’s your typical love story: boy meets girl  boy woos girl with his charming ways and big brown eyes  girl is swept off her feet  and they fall in love and live happily ever after. except in this story  the boy is an adopted puppy named louie..although i have a tremendous amount of leadership experience  i never truly understood leadership until i met this little guy..our blog  and my soon-to-be-released third book  louie’s leadership lessons  are compilations of time-tested leadership models  heart-warming stories of courage and love  and techniques for overcoming common issues such as pride  fear  and doubt—all illustrated by eye-opening experiences with my rescue dog. the time i spent with him and his trainer was life changing..this extended blog is the introduction to our new book and contains nuggets of wisdom i’ve learned over the decades about leadership and the gift of relationships with a fresh perspective renewed by louie’s point of view..i have distilled all louie has taught me into a leadership model that is easy to remember and easy to follow. when you have a leadership dilemma  ask yourself  “what would louie do?” the answer is in his name: louie..love.louie was either lost or abandoned in kentucky and made his way to cincinnati  where i live  through a number of shelters. although i love dogs  i had decided not to get another one for many reasons—that is  until i just happened to stop by petsmart while they were conducting an adopt-a-pet weekend and encountered this abandoned mutt with big brown. i tossed my concerns aside  brought him home  and named him louie distasi. i soon discovered that louie had brought a lot of emotional baggage to the relationship. he demonstrated behaviors that deeply concerned me  and i engaged a dog trainer to help address them. i quickly realized i needed training as much as louie did  if not more so..i’m not afraid of tough lessons  and i’m always looking for ways to improve my leadership skills. but working with louie was challenging. the bottom line was that louie needed acceptance  consistency  discipline  and—above all—unconditional love. i wasn’t sure i was equipped to provide all that..when i first met louie  he was very sweet and subdued in his crate. several hours after we arrived home  he became much more active. i loved louie when he was a good little dog  but i didn’t love him so much when he started to act out and behaved badly when people came to the door  etc. it was a struggle  and i had to make a choice to love him. i decided to commit to loving this abandoned pup  in spite of his baggage..employees can be like louie. they bring a lot of baggage to the job and may be hard to love at times. one of the most critical needs for any human being is the need to feel loved. all of us have this innate desire  yet it is one of the most difficult to fulfill. c. s. lewis said it best:.“to be loved but not known is comforting but superficial. to be known and not loved is our greatest fear. but to be fully known and truly loved is  well  a lot like being loved by god. it is what we need more than anything. it liberates us from pretense  humbles us out of our self-righteousness  and fortifies us for any difficulty life can throw at us.”.love is not merely a warm fuzzy feeling; love in action is the aspect that is important in leadership. when i mention the word “love” in the workplace  i receive a tremendous amount of pushback. people say  “don’t bring it up; you’ll have hr issues.” i question whether people understand what love really means..while employees can be hard to love at times (maybe most of the time)  it is still your choice to love or be indifferent toward them. let’s look at the characteristics of leaders who love:.they are patient..they are kind..they honor other people..they are honest..they are protective..they are trustworthy..they are always hopeful..they persevere through difficult situations..they are other seeking and other serving..they manage their emotions well..of course  there are also things that they are not:.they aren’t envious..they aren’t boastful..they aren’t prideful..they don’t keep records of wrongs..the characteristics of loving leaders are those that leaders should display when they are working with their people—baggage and all. that’s what love in action looks like..servant leaders are those who display the characteristics above. they are humble enough to serve and strong enough to lead..objectives and goals.the next thing i learned in the course of training louie was that  as a leader  i needed clear objectives and plans for how to achieve them. this is true with our teams at work  as well. objectives must be clear and specific. they have to be trackable. they have to be relevant. they have to be attainable and motivating..i engaged a trainer who taught me that my first goal in this journey with louie was to establish my role as leader. yep—i actually had to learn how to be louie’s alpha. i wrongly assumed he would know i was in charge because i’m bigger than him  i own the house  i pay for the meals. assuming is a mistake many leaders make. throughout our blog  you’ll read the importance of objectives and goals with each lesson i learned through louie..understanding.another lesson i learned was to truly understand that louie had “stuff” in his background. fear and anxiety issues were at the top of the list. these may have come from abandonment or abuse—it’s hard to say. but it is not unlike everyone we meet  whether he or she is on our team  or just a person whose path we crossed in the grocery store. every human being needs to feel loved and valued. it is our innermost need  and it was this little dog’s need as well. he had never had a sense of being valued in his life  and he needed to know that someone cared about him. i had to understand louie’s struggles to love him  which would enable me to set clear objectives and goals for our journey together. i needed to understand louie’s issues. it wasn’t easy to get past some of them. they were real and profound..as leaders  we need to take the time to understand our people. we need to realize that there’s always something about a person’s circumstances that we don’t know  and before we judge people  we need to try to understand them..when you run into an issue with someone and your first inclination is to become upset  try the paws method to help you analyze the situation before doing something you may regret:.pause…breathe! allow oxygen to get to your brain..ask the person questions: “what’s going on?” “can you tell me more?” “help me understand.” “is everything ok?” ask yourself questions: “why does this aggravate me?”.use wisdom. choose your words wisely. i would much rather have people feel uncomfortable waiting for me to find the right words than i ever would with words that could be hurtful..seek to understand. once you pause  ask questions  and choose your words wisely  you will naturally seek to understand. remember  everyone has “stuff” in his or her backgrounds. and so do you!.as leaders  we need to make an effort to understand. take time to understand your people and avoid making assumptions. throughout this blog  there are many lessons relating to how i learned to understand louie  who could not verbally communicate with me. these lessons will help you understand how others communicate and process ideas differently than you do—and that’s ok..investment.i then learned to invest my time and talent into developing louie. we should ask ourselves  “how much time do we invest in our teams? our families? our friends?” take the time to get to know people and invest in them..this picture breaks my heart. this is louie the first night he came home with me. he curled up in the corner  scared and alone. i put a pillow next to him to provide some comfort. louie now sleeps in a very open bed in my bedroom because he feels safe with me  and i with him. i chose to invest a tremendous amount of time in louie so that he could learn to trust and love me. it took time. everything takes time. you cannot go wrong by investing your time getting to know people. take them out to lunch. ask them questions. this point relates back to understanding. it links to feeling valued  and it relates to feeling loved. take time to gather information. you never know what you can uncover when you give your time..there are many suggestions for  and examples of  investing in others throughout our blog. get to know people  spend time with them  share your talents and your skill set; put effort into your relationships with people because you want to give without receiving anything in return. i can guarantee that if you are a leader  and you do this  your team will be more productive  creative  and effective. it is the foundation for a healthy culture. invest your time..empowerment.the last step in my leadership training with louie was to empower him. empowering your team is essential  but it’s not simply letting people do whatever they want to do. empowering is taking the time to love them and establishing clear objectives and goals. it is understanding them  and investing in them. once you do these things  your people will be empowered to use their gifts and talents to do their jobs; and in doing so  you empower them to be the people god created them to be—not who you think they should be. they will be loved and valued..louie is an entirely different dog today because i love him. i took the time to set up a development plan and was clear about objectives and goals for him to be a good  healthy dog and for us to enjoy a relationship together. i had to understand his needs. i had to understand his background. i had to figure out what was going on with him. i invested time  my skill set  and other people’s skill sets to help develop him. he is empowered to be a fun-loving  free little dog..my work with louie is not unlike leading our teams. transformation occurs when we apply the louie leadership model: love  objectives  understanding  investment  and empowerment  as well as the paws model: pause  ask  wisdom  and seek. throughout louie’s leadership lessons  you will see more examples of these two models wrapped in stories of love  struggles  and immense joy..while it brings me great pleasure to know that louie is a transformed dog  i am the one who has been profoundly changed into a better leader because of the lessons i’ve learned from my experiences with him. we look forward to continuing our journey with you through our

can hear him all the way down the street. people will turn and wait as louie’s whines get louder and his tail wags faster. he’ll run towards the person or one of his furry friends. he excitedly greets them and then boom! he’s on to the next friend..people know he’s going to do that to them. they watch him run and hear his excitement and after a few doggie sniffs he quickly moves on. my neighbors fully expect him to behave this way because they’ve witnessed this so many times. and now it’s the talk of the neighborhood…how snooty little louie distasi can be..i make excuses and justify his behavior by saying things like  “he’s very focused on his walk ” or “don’t take it personal  he’s anxious to keep moving.” it is obvious his reputation clearly precedes him as we walk through the neighborhood..this behavior has me ponder the importance of our reputations. it is much harder to build a reputation than to destroy it. building a good reputation requires patience  solid values  intentionality and time. destroying a good reputation only requires a single moment’s mistake. to build a good reputation  be a person who is worthy of one. demonstrate the characteristics you want others to associate with you..i had the honor and pleasure to work with ken blanchard in early 2000. during a lead like jesus workshop in 2001  he shared a memorable exercise that left an indelible imprint on my mind and heart..ken told a story about swedish chemist alfred bernhard nobel  who invented dynamite in 1866 and became rich. nobel was as interested in drama and poetry as he was in chemistry and physics  but it was in the sciences that he made his fame  and by the time of his death he held more than 350 patents and controlled factories and labs in 20 countries..when alfred nobel’s brother died a newspaper mistakenly published an obituary of alfred that emphasized the fact that he had invented things that blew up and killed people. nobel  not wanting to be remembered in that way  pledged his wealth toward the betterment of humanity. in his will he directed the establishment of a foundation to award annual prizes for achievement in chemistry  physics  literature  and efforts toward international peace  which is known as the nobel prize. this award is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the world and includes a cash prize of nearly one million dollars..ken asked  “what do you want your obituary to say about you?” he had the participants write out their thoughts. and then he asked  “what do you have to do today to be the person you want to be remembered as?”.that exercise had a profound effect on me then and still does today. i don’t want to be gone and people have to drum up something about me being a compassionate and deeply caring person. i commit to living out those characteristics today..i encourage you to do the exercise ken has had so many people around the world engage in doing: write your own obituary. take time to figure out how you want to be remembered and then commit to being that person today!.as for louie  it may be too late. it seems his reputation precedes him and not in a good way. we’ll have to continue to work on his relational skills and how he engages with others. stay tuned!.**louie and i hope you and your family will join us in remembering the countless men and women who have fought for our country. give thanks for those who have given their lives and always thank a veteran and those currently serving!**.click the image for information on how to order louie’s leadership lessons.email

upon two dogs we’ve never met before. one of them is a twin of louie. she is a corgi-beagle mix  and she even has the same facial markings as louie. she is a bit smaller than louie  and her name is peanut..there was a noticeable difference  however  in the size of their mouths. like her name  she was a peanut  and her mouth was tiny compared to louie’s very big mouth. louie’s mouth can do many things: bark  growl  show his teeth  eat  and mouth to pull and play. louie provides “love taps” by poking his mouth against your hand when he is excited to see you. his mouth is conveniently attached to his nose which he uses to poke and prod. they work together to borough in the ground and pull lumps of grass to get to a mole..although louie’s large mouth is actually harmless  he could do a lot of damage with it. this is not unlike ourselves. our mouths  specifically our tongues  may seem harmless  but oh the damage they can do and usually  unnecessarily..i love what the bible teaches us about the tongue. “a bit in the mouth of a horse controls the whole horse. a small rudder on a huge ship in the hands of a skilled captain sets a course in the face of the strongest winds. a word out of your mouth may seem of no account  but it can accomplish nearly anything—or destroy it! it only takes a spark  remember  to set off a forest fire. a careless or wrongly placed word out of your mouth can do that. by our speech we can ruin the world  turn harmony to chaos  throw mud on a reputation  send the whole world up in smoke and go up in smoke with it…” and “you can tame a tiger  but you can’t tame a tongue—it’s never been done.”.we have the power to use our words to give life or to bring death to our relationships. hurtful words can be used in slander  gossip  arguing  criticizing  complaining  distasteful language  boasting  and lying. and the damage can be irreparable. as we read that list  we shake our heads for we clearly know others who do these things. yet  there’s a small voice within us that whispers  “could this be me?”.i believe we are all guilty of some or all of these things. for the sake of brevity  let’s focus on the first two: gossip and slander. by definition  gossip is sharing personal or sensational facts about others; sharing private information with those who are not part of the problem or solution. slander is using words  tonal patterns or facial expressions to deliberately damage someone else’s reputation with information that does not need to be shared..we all do this either subtly or with as much gusto as possible  and perhaps we are not aware of the damage we are doing. i am most grieved by those who teach and preach against gossip and yet do so under the guise of caring for the person they are talking about  or worse  having the need to play the victim role and share how unfair someone treated them..it takes intentionality to not step foot on the slippery slope of gossip and slander. it is not easy  but i am committing to these steps  thanks to louie’s inspiration:.paws.pause: there is power in the pause. when we pause before speaking  we gain time to process our thoughts. i’d rather make people uncomfortable with my pause than with my words. i’ve never regretted my pauses  but too many times  i have regretted my words..ask: ask yourself these things: what’s going on with me? why do i have this need to share this? would i want this person sharing information about me? would i share this if the other person were in front of me? reflect on your answers before you speak..wisdom: choose your words wisely. when we speak from a place of wisdom  people are more inclined to listen. carefully consider the words you are about to say. if they are not life-giving  do not say them. nothing good comes from useless  mindless words..stop and seek to understand: stop gossiping for one day. when we want to lose weight  we log our food to keep track of what we are putting into our bodies. take a day this week to log how many times you talk about someone else. that may make you more aware of how easily gossip has seeped into your life. then ask a friend to hold you accountable when you are together  and commit to not talking about others. seek to understand the other person before casting judgement..through my relationship with louie  i have learned a tremendous amount about my relationships with humans. with the size of his mouth  he could take a chunk out of someone  but he clearly chooses not to (up to this point). in that same way  i want nothing to stand in my way with those who are in my life  even those with whom i interact for a short time. i am going to stamp out gossip and slander in my life using the paws method. i hope you will join me..categories balance of

he sleeps until i awake  then he jumps on the bed when i call him for morning snuggles  after which he heads down to the kitchen for his breakfast  back up stairs to watch out the window  then goes on a walk after i’ve showered and dressed  (this is all before 7a.m.). his days are mixed with whatever my schedule includes. sometimes that means long walks  a visit to the park  or visits with the grandpups (evi and mea). other times are spent in his cozy crate (whether i’m home working or out) and an afternoon walk with sully. he has dinner  then an evening walk and play time  and he’s off to bed at 8:30 p.m.…no matter what is going on in my home..i’ll change our walking pattern and even then he will stand at the crossroad and wait to see what direction i’ll go in and then happily trots off in that direction. his habits make him feel comfortable. and given his past  i am happy to accommodate him..i have to laugh when i watch his quirky little ways. i am reminded of a story i heard long ago from zig zigler. a young bride was cooking dinner for her husband. he watched her carefully season the roast and then proceed to cut off one end  and then the other end. he asked his wife why she cut off the ends of the roast. she replied that her mother had always done it that way and that was reason enough for her. since the wife’s mother was visiting  they asked her why she always cut off the end of the roast. mother replied that this was the way her mother did it. mother  daughter and son-in-law then decided to call grandmother and solve this three-generation mystery. grandmother promptly replied that she cut the end of the roast because her roaster was too small to cook it in one piece..we do things a certain way because we’ve always done them that way and  quite honestly  we’re comfortable with that. but is that always the best way? not necessarily. regardless of who originally penned this saying  whether albert einstein  henry ford  or perhaps mark twain  these words still ring true today: “if you always do what you’ve always done  you will always get what you’ve always got.” many work environments today are stuck in the “we’ve always done it that way ” syndrome with no end in sight..history and tradition are necessary for a rich working environment where people learn how the business started and how it has grown. and many processes are in place because of the hours put into finding just the right workflow. however  many ideas are tossed to the wayside because a leader or leaders cannot see that though something might have worked in the past  there are possibilities to make a change for the better going forward. even worse  sometimes our prejudices are based on “we’ve always [voted  practiced  treated people] that way” in the past and we’re not self aware enough to break out of that thinking..the key to breaking through this barrier is trust! when i challenge louie to do things a different way  he trusts me enough to comply. he may look at me as if to say  “are you sure?” or “is this the way  really?” but he carries on because he trusts me..if leaders are secure in their roles and they exude trust with their team and vice versa  the culture breeds openness and spontaneity of new ideas. the next time there’s even a hint of we’ve always done it this way (waditw)  carefully consider the following steps:.stop before saying another word and take a deep breath!.ask a question that begins with  “what if…”.leader  remain quiet and listen..brainstorm  write down all the ideas on a white board. give people ample time to ponder and discuss..review all possibilities and decide on a path of growth together. you may decide the way you’ve done it is the best way at this point  but at least you’ll have more buy in..accountability is the key to keeping trust alive and follow through on getting things done..i know this takes time and effort  but the loss of creativity and teamwork has a much greater cost on productivity  efficiency and profitability for the organization as a whole. breaking through the barrier of waditw is freeing and breeds a culture of trust  thereby increasing engagement..while louie likes his comfortable habits  he also exudes excitement when i change things up for him. he can sense my enthusiasm  and he trusts that whatever adventure i am willing to go on  will be good for him..click the image for

home alone so often  and i worry he gets lonely when i’m not around. he gets plenty of exercise thanks to sully and his mom  but he’s a pack animal  and i don’t think i’m enough “pack” for him..but then i remember my first doggie duo. my daughter marisa and i were convinced that buffy  the first dog we owned together  was lonely and needed a buddy. so we brought a very energetic bichon puppy named bree home when buffy was 3-years-old…she was buffy’s worst nightmare..then after buffy died  we adopted cece. cece wanted me all to herself  which was not going to happen as long as bree was around. after they passed within three years of each other  i took a break from any more doggie drama. and now there’s louie!.but i noticed something interesting about louie. he loves his buddies and will whine to go out to play  but when he’s done  he comes home and quietly goes to his man cave. he has a spot in my bedroom and a crate on the lower level of my home and he prefers that no one invade his privacy. after observing his behavior over the last two plus years  it is clear he loves to be alone. even when i’m home  he is not under my feet. he will go into his crate while i am working or go to his favorite spot to look out the window..perhaps this is a learned behavior after living with me since 2013. i love to be alone. i enjoy the quietness of my home  and i reenergize by spending time alone. i plan for plenty of white space on my calendar for that purpose. i guard that time because it is precious to me. i would never be able to pour into people as i do if i did not have plenty of time alone..the reactions i receive when i tell people i’m an introvert ranges from utter disbelief to acknowledgement that they catch a glimpse of introversion occasionally. the audiences i speak to are usually the ones who display disbelief because their idea of an introvert is not someone who is comfortable giving speeches. i learned many years ago from my friend  lynne ruhl  the primary difference between an introvert and an extrovert. she asked one simple question: you’ve been around people all day at work or at a social event. upon arriving home you receive a call from a friend who invites you to a party. would you turn around and head out to the party or politely decline to stay home? i didn’t hesitate…stay home!.she explained that it doesn’t mean i am shy or socially awkward or even afraid of public speaking. it simply means i recharge by being alone..the terms extrovert and introvert refer to the ways people use their energy. these words have psychological meaning that is different from the way they are used in everyday language. everyone spends some time extroverting and some time introverting. don’t confuse introversion with shyness or reclusiveness. they are not related and i am far from shy..and things get really tricky when you throw in a new term ambivert  a word used to describe someone who exhibits qualities of both introversion and extroversion. stop it! i’m an introvert who functions quite well in an extroverted world  and i love my time alone..good leaders understand that people have differing ways of directing their energies. not everyone will respond the same way even in the same situations. have your extroverted employees that have woo as a strength (winning others over) go to the social networking events. be aware of what energizes and what drains all your employees..i sometimes wonder if the superficiality of our culture today  thanks to social media  hasn’t made me more keenly aware of being introverted. as someone who is very relational  my connection with others is key to my well-being. yet  i still prefer time alone rather than engage in any insincere or phony relationship. and now i have an introverted dog that lives with me  and i’m thankful we are so compatible. he makes coming home even more of a welcome reprieve..categories balance of strong  be

danisedistasi.i’ve noticed something a bit different lately about louie  my rescue pup. he really enjoys it when we walk side by side during our walks. what’s different about that  you might ask?.he’s always enjoyed our time together and is usually all over the place when we walk. to get him to walk right next to me (as we’ve been taught during dog training)  i usually have to make him heel. what’s different now is that he heels without me giving the command. now he walks right next to me  many times for the entire walk  enjoying every step. it’s like we’re bffs just hanging out. well  maybe we are  but this change in our walks together gives me paws to think about leadership..louie walks next to me with confidence and joy because i  his leader  am walking with confidence and joy. this time last year i was still recuperating from a terrible accident. and  needless to say  this winter  though i was out walking  i walked with extreme caution. now that the weather is turning warmer  there’s a bit more spring in my step and i am back to walking confidently and fast. and louie is reaping the benefits..when i say  “leader  you must walk with confidence ” it may conjure up a lot of different thoughts and feelings about leadership. many leaders walk with confidence because of pride issues  others put on airs and act like they’re confident. i believe the leaders who truly are confident provide a safe place for employees to flourish. those leaders are confident not in their own abilities but in the abilities and strengths of those they lead. they can walk with confidence because they have a team around them they believe in  one they have encouraged and affirmed  and they work well together..walking with confidence is not about you  it is about those you lead  those you’ve empowered to be who they were created to be. it’s not about you puffing yourself up  it’s about those who choose to follow you and the confidence they have in you to be an excellent leader. take the challenge and walk with confidence  but be sure it is because of the outward focus you have on the strengths and skills of others on your team..as for louie  well  i’m pretty sure if he were writing this it would be all about his confidence and how he walks next to me to make sure i am protected. way to go  louie! such a good boy!.*********.louie had to say goodbye to his cousin  perry  a couple

reignite your sense of wonder.october 3  2017 october 3  2017 by danisedistasi.louie hit a rough patch last week. one night shortly after settling into our nightly routine  he became restless. he rarely dances around to signal his need to go outside; when he did so  we made it to the front yard just in the nick of time. he clearly had an upset stomach and was one miserable little pup..i wasn’t sure how he would fare through the night  but i knew he would let me know if he needed to make a trip outside. sure enough  at midnight and then again at 1:30 a.m.  he woke me up  needing to go out. i was administering the proper foods to settle his digestive system  but i had already decided to call the vet in the morning to get him in as soon as possible..then something magical happened. it’s tough to put the words “magical” and “upset stomach” in the same sentence  but that is exactly what took place. while i was thinking through all the practical reasons louie was sick and slowly trying to coax him back into the house  he stopped and looked far off into the distance. normally  louie can become nervous when he’s outside in the dark; he usually wants to head back inside as soon as possible. our trainer has advised me that i need to walk boldly and with confidence when we’re outside after dark so that louie will feel safe..but standing outside at 1:30 in the morning  i had no desire to be the alpha. i just wanted to go back to bed with a hope and a prayer that louie would be on the mend. at the moment  though  louie was fixated on something that grabbed his attention; even with a slight tug  he would not move..then it happened. rather than scurrying back to the safety of the house  we stood and took in the magic of a peaceful  quiet night. he slowly looked from the street up to the stars above. i stopped  too  and looked. the sky was beautiful  and the quietness with a few faint nighttime sounds was breathtaking. louie seemed to marvel at the night sky. i noticed it  too—and it grabbed my heart..we spent a long moment drinking in the beauty. i looked at my pup  and we both knew it was time to go in. after our midnight reverie  whatever louie tapped into must have healed his nerves because he settled in for a long  deep sleep. the next day  he woke up without a trace of sickness..as i type out this message  i am compelled to ponder this thought: when did i lose this sense of wonder? i see it emerge when i play with my grandchildren—when we go off on adventures. but as louie and i stood together that evening  i realized that it can be easy to mistake wonder for foolishness. in fact  i have to ask myself—is this thought just foolishness?.i so desire to reignite my sense of incredible marvel. for me  this is about more than being creative: it is seeing the beauty and magic in the world all around us—the creation that god breathed life into. it is engaging with a dear friend in deep  heartwarming conversation. it is watching my beautiful niece walk along a peaceful garden path to join her soon-to-be-husband in their outdoor wedding ceremony. it is witnessing the miraculous birth of my grandchildren. it is running outside to catch the ice cream truck as it passes through my neighborhood—and having my brother and his family joining me  which happened just last week. four adults standing in my driveway eagerly anticipating the thrill of eating ice cream from a truck  unprompted by children!.admit it—we yearn to be moved by seeing things beyond our physical world filled with horrific news. we all want to feel profoundly alive  to feel like we’re a part of the grander scheme of things for the greater good. yet many of us have lost this sense of curiosity. moments that might have taken our breath away from our younger selves now may not move us at all..if you are a leader in an organization  community  or family  what are ways you could reignite your sense of wonder? perhaps you feel aware that you’ve lost it  or perhaps you still do experience it. what about those you lead—do you see glimpses of their capacity for awe? the greatest gift you can give to others is to help them navigate uncertain waters and enter that new world with them. you can choose to intentionally engage in conversations with your team about recapturing this magical sense. you and your team may be surprised by feeling powerfully impacted as you tap into this sense..i hope louie never loses his sense of wonder. i am not saying that he has this down  or even that he is cognizant of his tender sense of awe. nevertheless  i envy his ability to stop and connect with creation and draw from that a sense of peace. even on that night without sleep  unexpected and moving lessons were shown to me by my pup  louie..********.if you recall my blogs at the beginning of the year  i had a life-changing event take place. my goal then was to dance at my niece’s wedding…and dance we did!.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble

whining.february 6  2017 february 7  2017 by danisedistasi.a passing thought drifted through my mind the other day: i will miss all the love and attention i have received over the past few weeks. but since i would rather hear “wow  you’re doing so well” than “oh  gee  sorry you’re still struggling with your recovery ” the thought passed quickly  never to return..because i’m ready to close the chapter on my accident and subsequent surgery  my passing thought is not what the subject line is referring to. this is a blog about my persnickety pup louie and his ever-increasing need to whine. while i know he suffered trauma over the past couple of months along with me  his whining seems to have increased exponentially rather than to have subsided as i would have expected. i soon discovered his behavior has nothing to do with my injury. instead  louie is reacting to a new dog in the neighborhood..this new dog represents everything louie hates. the dog is a male  he’s bigger than lou  and he’s . . . shhhh . . . not neutered. the last issue sends louie into a tizzy even before we walk out the door. his hackles go up  and he puffs out his chest and huffs as he walks out. but then the incessant whining begins. and once he starts that  it’s tough to get him to stop..one morning as we exited the garage  we made a sharp left turn out of our driveway and hurried away from where the dog lives as quickly as a girl with a cane can manage. louie looked back  whined  and seemed disoriented. i tugged on his collar and gave a stern command  “leave it ” which he immediately obeyed  but his memory is keen  and it quickly took him back to the dark side. i was hoping he would find a new smell to distract him..thanks to zig our dog trainer  i learned a long time ago that louie whines out of fear  so i have to step up and walk with confidence. that’s tough to do considering i’m still healing  but i did the best i could. louie suspiciously eyed the cane  and then looked back at me with a face that said he was not convinced i could protect us both . . . and i didn’t blame him..as our walk settled into a more relaxed pace  i reflected on why some people  like louie  seem to whine so much. do you have a few whiners on your team? it’s easy to get frustrated and dismiss them  but there is usually something deeper going on that we may never uncover unless we take the time to do so..fear is a big issue for louie  which is why he whines. fear is a big issue for people as well and could be the reason some folks whine. i have learned to counter louie’s fear  not with my confidence but with love. love is the first step of the louie leadership model:.love is foundational to building trust and integrity for a personal or professional relationship to flourish. without love and trust  our relationships are like fragile shells that have nothing inside of them and with the slightest amount of pressure  are easily shattered. because of the love i have demonstrated for louie on a regular basis  he has learned to trust me. [for more on leading with trust  see this article by my friend  randy conley  vice president of client services & trust practice leader for the ken blanchard companies.].a teammate may whine because the team is experiencing a daunting and uncomfortable change. loving people through such change does not mean we coddle them. it means we shed light on the situation  we share the truth  and we press through together..love is more impactful than complaining to others that someone is a whiner..our society tends to misuse the word love. in fact  very few understand the strength and character it takes to love others. we have fluffy commercials about it  emoticons  and facebook posts. martin luther king  jr. said  “darkness cannot drive out darkness  only light can do that. hate cannot drive out hate  only love can do that.”.and who can argue with this verse: “such love has no fear because perfect love expels all fear. if we are afraid  it is for fear of punishment  and this shows that we have not fully experienced his (god’s) perfect love.”.i doubt louie will be able to love the new dog in the neighborhood anytime soon. in fact  i’m sure he is hoping the dog moves away. in the meantime  i’m working on loving lou through this ordeal and rebuilding his confidence and trust in me so he knows i will never allow another dog to threaten him..but louie is a dog and as humans  we can choose to love. you can be the change agent for someone by removing fear of punishment or detrimental consequences and instilling love instead. such love is the gateway to experiencing god’s perfect love and the cornerstone on which excellent and effective leadership is built..note: my friend t.d. hughes knows how emphatic i am about leadership and love and recently sent me an article i thought you would enjoy as well. it’s okay to love your employees.**speaking of love  louie sends his love for a wonderful valentine’s day**.picture compliments of louie’s favorite place  best

that means!.january 24  2017 january 24  2017 by danisedistasi.our last blog detailed a journey i’m glad to say i am more than halfway through. if all goes well  my release date from all restrictions is february 1  2017. i am off all pain medication  and i took my first solo drive yesterday. i am beginning to see some normalcy slowly trickle back into my life. again  i am completely humbled by the continued outpouring of love and encouragement. thank you!.and then  there’s louie! louie was as traumatized as i was through this journey. he had to adjust to my being gone for two weeks; friends coming and going  walking and feeding him  playing with him  all while he constantly watched the door with the hope i would walk through it any minute..now that i’m home and he’s learned to trust my erratic movements with a cane  he seems to have settled back into some interesting habits: growling at people who come to my door (even his dog walkers) and jumping on the couch to sit directly across from me (better to watch me  he says)..one evening  a friend came by to take louie for a walk. after they finished and she came in to sit with me for awhile  he ran into the house  checked on me  and then ran upstairs  where he ran the length of the hallway several times. then  i heard a big commotion  and from where i was sitting  i could tell what that little rascal was doing. he was getting into my clothesbasket in my bathroom and taking all the clothes out of it  having no consideration whatsoever for the amount of time it took me to get the clothes into that basket..his continued motion  which was evident even though he was a floor above me  indicated he not only removed the items from the basket  he was also rolling in them—all of them! some time ago  i explained to zig  our trainer  louie’s annoying bad habit of rolling in the dirty laundry. i assumed it was because he wanted to surround himself with my smell  weird as that is..but zig assured me that was not it at all. louie was getting his smell on my clothes  showing his dominance over me. what? now that is a really annoying bad habit that makes me realize we are back to square one. there will be no dominance of louie over me..but this is not surprising. when it takes all my energy to walk from the living room to the kitchen  disciplining a dog is not high on my list  especially since we’ve been through this before. the pressure was off of louie to behave well  and when the pressure is off  he reverts back to his old habits..that is so like us. a while ago  i wrote a blog about something i learned from my time with the ken blanchard companies about the dynamics of change. one dynamic is that when the pressure is off  we revert to our original behaviors. well  the pressure was definitely off  and louie was back to some of his old habits. we will need to spend time correcting that. but rather than lament  i reflected on what this means as far as my recent journey and getting “back to normal.”.finally being able to drive did give me a sense of life getting back to normal. getting off medication  walking better  and looking forward to some normalcy were great goals for recovery. but did i really want normalcy to be my goal?.not this time  not this year. i am going to be intentional (keeping the pressure on) about breaking past the norm to live a well-meaning life by doing the following:.pruning activities  objects  and even some relationships  all to devote precious time to what matters;.being kind in thought  word  and deed  whether people deserve it or not. i don’t mean just merely being nice (and sometimes superficial and phony)  but being authentic and loving—speaking truth in love and showing those who differ from me  or have differing viewpoints  the compassion that only comes from faith in god;.taking time to listen in order to learn—and not rushing to the next project;.being still and having plenty of margin in my life;.laughing more; and.dancing (okay  that one is normal for me  but now takes on an even more special meaning). i will take time to dance more with my grandchildren and even my adult daughter because that’s what distasi kids do. my niece sara is getting married in september  and she has promised we will dance the night away. that is my goal for 2017..be intentional about breaking past the norm. life is too short and too easily interrupted for us to stay stuck in the status quo. and you are never too old to take that first step to crashing through the “same ol’  same ol’.”.as for louie  we have some work to do. as i have been writing  he slipped into my laundry room and pulled out a dishtowel. he is so bad. i know he has a large fan base of people who love him  but this annoying little habit just makes me shake my head. i suppose being intentionally kind starts now with little louie distasi!.click the cover to order louie’s leadership legacy book..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble

danisedistasi.today was the first day i was able to wrap my arms around louie and give him a huge bear hug. it was three weeks ago that i had an accident and our lives quickly changed. and in celebrating my ability to hug him and receive an under the neck snuggle from him  i thought it fitting to resume our blog after an unintentionally extended vacation..december 18  2016  was filled with great anticipation. it was one week before christmas  and the distasi family was planning to gather at my house to celebrate christmas. everything was set; the massive amounts of food  the decorations  gifts  and music. it was to be a celebration to top all the ones we had celebrated so far as a family..louie and i took our usual stroll early that morning. two days before  there had been a late evening ice storm  but this particular morning seemed okay as far as icy pavement was concerned. still  i was cautious and walked in the grass as much as possible..an elderly neighbor has a very long driveway  and louie and i had been taking her daily newspaper to her so she would not have to venture out and lean over to pick it up. as soon as i stepped on the driveway  my feet flew up in the air  and i landed on my left hip. i lost control of louie  and it took me a few moments to catch my breath. i couldn’t see louie  and panic was about to set in. his normal reaction when something startles him is to run away. and seeing his mama flying through the air had to have been startling..i forced myself to turn as far to the left as i could. there louie sat  close behind my left shoulder. i reached around to draw him close to me. as he tucked his head under my arm  i felt his shaking and heard him whimper. to hear him cry broke my heart  and my tears started to flow uncontrollably. i knew i could not move—and whatever would take place from that moment forward  it would be a long journey. louie chose to stay by me as the faithful friend that he is..a neighbor pulled up with his phone in hand  already calling 911  and i called my friend and neighbor cindy to pick up louie. i called my daughter  marisa  and the network of community  family  and friends jumped into action. everyone’s life was interrupted on december 18  2016..after a jarring ambulance ride  surgery to repair a femur that was fractured in two places  a total hip replacement  five days in the hospital  and physical therapy  i was released to marisa and matt’s home for respite care and to celebrate christmas with the two cutest nurses on the face of the earth. louie had been well taken care of by my wonderful neighbors who had walked him  let him stay in their homes  taken him to daycare to play  and given him more love than he could imagine..life interrupted has taught louie and me a few things:.we appreciate life and the little things: although that seems so cliché  it was the small steps of accomplishment that filled me with joy. every day  i set new goals to accomplish—goals i never would have dreamed to set before. for instance  i learned to get out of bed  to go to the bathroom  and to take my meds without having to wake my daughter to help me. and to carry a cup of coffee in the morning to enjoy my quiet time. mea and evi helped me do things as they watched me improve. christmas had a deeper meaning this year with sincere thankfulness  love  and joy!.you really do know who your friends are: so many people dropped everything to help. it was a terrible strain on marisa and matt as they took care of me. so many friends offered to grocery shop  run errands  and stay with me when i finally came home. my sisters and cousin packed their clothes and took turns staying overnight. my brothers were calling  visiting  and bringing food. the neighbors who took care of louie were such godsends. many people could not help because of logistics  but they checked in and prayed..you have to move out of your comfort zone: this was a tough one for louie and me. i had to let people help me. what a humbling position to be in; i was helpless. i have never stayed in a hospital other than to give birth. i don’t take any medicines  and i have never fractured a single bone. the outpouring of love and encouragement has been overwhelming. louie had to be comfortable with people coming and going in and out of our home and driving him to and from daycare. but we both pressed on through pain  frustration  fear  and being uncomfortable. it was difficult  but i believe we made it past the hardest part of this process. there’s still much more healing to take place and there will always be a next move out of our comfort zone. i have no doubt we’ll press through that too..some things just do not matter: the superficiality of the holidays clashed with the richness of genuine  loving relationships. there can be no comparison of the things that are bought with the things that are sought  caught  and taught. the characteristics of love  joy  and peace are important for us to live and pass on to others. it takes effort  but it is worth the time and effort. i am a better person because of the love  joy  and peace that others shared with me this season..2017 is going to be a great year of love and strength. louie is a better dog because he chose faithfulness over running away. he trusted and allowed others into his world to help us! we are closer because of these last few weeks. thank you to so many for being in my life and for your prayers and support!.click here to sign up for louie’s email list..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and

expectancy.december 12  2016 december 13  2016 by danisedistasi.louie  my adopted pup  and i were walking on a beautiful fall day when we saw one of his pug buddies—or so we thought. his friend sammy is a tan and black pug with a unique characteristic: his tongue protrudes ever so slightly. i recognized that the person walking him was not his owner. that’s not unusual since many of us in the community need others to walk our dogs on occasion. louie was excited to see his buddy and could hardly wait to romp and play..as we approached  i asked if the dog was sammy  because he had the same markings and same characteristic of a slightly protruding tongue. the person walking him said no. but louie quickly ran up to the sammy look-alike; it did not take him long to realize this was not his buddy  and then he became indignant as if he was mad at the pug for not being sammy..we quickly said our good-byes while louie kicked up his feet and snarled just to make sure the dog understood he was not even close to being sammy..i realized louie’s expectations for playing with his friend were unmet  and disappointment had set in quickly. based on all appearances  louie was expecting to have fun and play  but that expectation was not to be filled that day..this time of year  the majority of us have many expectations that  when unmet for whatever reason  will disappoint us. people have a hard time moving on from such setbacks. i think these disappointments occur because we’ve set ourselves up for failure when we box up our expectations in the hopes that they will be fulfilled..instead  what if we had a spirit of expectancy? you may wonder what the difference is between having expectations and having a spirit of expectancy. a spirit of expectancy is what very young children usually possess. they have the mindset that something wonderful is about to happen  but with no expectation of specifics. while they may wish for something on their christmas list  it is their heart of expectancy that is truly magical. it is the hopefulness of something wonderful. for me  that may entail time with my family  but without expectation that the time meets any specific criteria—it is simply time together..another example occurred on the holiest of nights. for centuries  people expected the messiah to come amongst their midst. in this expectation  they envisioned a king  surrounded by throngs of noble men and women and trumpets blaring. because of these expectations they missed the wonder of all that took place on that quiet  serene night when the stars were brightly shining..yet only those with a spirit of expectancy  whose hearts were open to the wonder of what only the creator of the universe could put into action  witnessed the birth of the king in a simple  lowly manger..expectations for particular things and events always run the risk of disappointing us  since many times  events and what others do are out of our control. as we wind down our year  rather than focusing on the disappointments of unmet expectations  let’s look forward with a heart of expectancy and see if that doesn’t lighten our spirits with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen..while louie experienced disappointment by not having his expectations met with the look-alike sammy  it did not dampen his spirit of expectancy. he still walks out of our home with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen. something as simple as seeing a dear neighbor who pats him on the head or gives him belly rubs lends to his heart of wonder..click the image for

november 29  2016 by danisedistasi.the subject line might offend louie. in fact  it might offend you as well. but let’s face it—in the heat of the recent political battle  many of us are shaking our heads while trying to understand what just happened. one thing i do know is that disrespect for people with differing opinions is at an all-time high..the rude rhetoric on all sides of the political spectrum gave me pause and made me think of louie and some of his not-so-friendly foes. i am convinced that if people were to act the way our pets do  we would all get along better. for example  sometimes louie might see a dog that challenges him. the two will snarl and growl and perhaps even bark at each other. however  the minute we walk side by side with the dog and its owner  they seem to get along. there is something about being intentional and walking alongside someone you have a disagreement with..louie has done this with my niece’s dog  buddy. those two little boys will scrunch their noses  curl their lips  show their teeth  stand their hair up  and bark in such a high pitch that people turn their heads with a look of concern. andrea laughs  assuring everyone in sight that the dogs are actually cousins and are fine with each other. it sure doesn’t seem like it when they are facing one another. however  as soon as we start walking  they are fine together..louie also behaves this way with rambunctious claire  his other cousin noli  his neighbor snickers  and a new boxer in the community named socks. what is it about being side by side with their supposed nemesis? i think there are several things:.it is less threatening..they are on equal ground..they see the same vision of what lies ahead..they walk with the same pace..it is easier to carry the other’s burden. (okay  this one relates to humans  not louie.).what if some of our leaders were intentional about walking side by side instead of duking it out? i am reminded of an article i wrote in 2005 when i worked with ken blanchard titled “leading with your heart takes humility.” although it was written over eleven years ago  the premise holds true today: humility is the key to excelling in leadership. and servant leaders are humble enough to walk beside someone they disagree with..i won’t share the full article here (you can find it at this link)  but here are some of the highlights:.something is glaringly missing from leadership today. sadly  many leadership programs are missing just one key ingredient: the heart. not just the heart of the issue or the heart of the matter—the heart of the people..what gets in your way? what truly is your motive for being a leader or wanting to lead others? is it for selfish gain or to better others?.many times  our ego gets in the way and what bubbles up out of our hearts are things like pride  selfishness  and even fear..how can you push past what holds you back? in getting past the barriers  is the challenge as a leader to balance confidence with humility to fight ego issues? ken blanchard often uses the quote  “humility is not thinking less of yourself. it’s thinking of yourself less.” every time you make a leadership decision  are you thinking of yourself or others?.confidence does not come from being in a dominant position and leading by intimidation. doing this will cause you to lose respect from others  and any talk about values or integrity will be ignored. humility  however  is not something they teach us in business schools. it is a character trait that is honed over time with truth and love..our businesses  organizations  and families are hungry for leadership coupled with humility. it takes commitment to make the necessary changes to have a healthy culture and humble leaders..perhaps our world could learn a lesson from louie about being intentional and walking side by side with others rather than snarling at them. while louie doesn’t understand humility  his actions speak louder than his woof. he is more than willing to walk alongside others. as i watch his actions  i am convinced that we humans have much to learn from our dogs..louie’s newest revision is now available. click on the book to order..click here to sign up for louie’s email distribution!.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  conflict  consistency  courage  fear and pride  forgiveness  fundamentals in leadership  gossip  healthy culture  honesty  ken blanchard  leadership  moral compromise  relationships  respect  servant leadership  trust  truth tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  #pridegetsintheway  #toughlessons  danise distasi  distasi advisors  healthy cultures  healthy relationships  louie's leadership lessons  realational leadership 2 comments.territorial or protective—what’s the difference?.september 27  2016 september 28  2016 by danisedistasi.louie and i have a very touchy subject to discuss  one that is also a continuing issue. just when i think louie is over this particular behavior  he reverts to square one  and we have to start training all over again..every time someone comes to my door  he has a very strong reaction; he starts barking  growling  and lowering his head—all signs that he is ready to attack  even though he has never attacked anyone. while this is great for all the intruders that come to my door  it can also be annoying since most are guests or delivering expected packages..my guests will walk in  fully expecting an overly excited dog to greet them. i’ve worked with louie to sit and remain seated until i give him a release signal. only then can he approach the guest and smell the person. but the minute i do not enforce this training  he goes right back to his bad behavior..ever since i’ve known louie  he has had only great experiences at my front door. i have welcomed everyone who has entered with hugs  and they love seeing louie. he has never encountered someone breaking in  trying to kidnap me  or causing any commotion whatsoever at the front door. the people he encounters are simply entering my home..i had to ask myself  what would cause this behavior? did he have a bad past experience? is he afraid someone will take him from his cushy environment? does he not want me to give anyone else any attention? none of this made sense..when i share about his behavior with others  everyone says he is just being protective  and i’m left again to ask why. why does he think i need protection? and if i do need it  then shouldn’t he react the same way when we are on a walk and someone approaches me? but he doesn’t. he could care less. in fact  i am sure that if someone with ill intent approached me  he would run in the opposite direction as fast as he could. he doesn’t care if i pet other dogs  and all my neighbors can attest to this behavior—but only outside..inside my house  it’s a different story. over the last three years  i have realized that louie is indeed protecting his territory. given his history  he has a profound need to feel safe and clearly does not want anyone disrupting that. while i appreciate that and want him to feel safe  it annoys me to fight this battle every time someone comes to my door. being territorial is not very becoming and can turn many people away. i have to shake my head and wonder why dogs  especially louie  behave that way. and then it hit me: i am the very same way. i am territorial..for instance  i struggled with sharing the louie leadership model in our last blog because of the thoughts that slowly began to creep into my mind and heart. someone  i thought  will steal it and call it their own (no one ever does that in the training/consulting world  right?) or say they thought of it first. and so on. such thoughts continued to color my excitement about developing and sharing the model and the louie stories that accompanied each step. while i shake my head and ask louie why he acts like he does  i had to ask myself the same question. what benefit is it to anyone if i am territorial and hoard a new idea?.it is humbling to realize that a behavior is very unbecoming. we humans are so often territorial when we think we have a great idea  a unique method  or a new creation. an old expression often brings me back to reality:.there is nothing new under the sun!.louie’s behavior is typical of most dogs. for humans to want to protect their turf is normal. but just because it is “typical” or “normal” behavior does not mean it is acceptable. i shared the louie model because it is a really great model and not mine to hoard. it was gifted to me by the one who blessed me with louie—god. and i believe god wants me to give freely to others the gifts with which he has blessed me..now if i can just get louie to see our home as a gift that we should share with others  we’d be so much better off! we have a lot of work to do!.***********.louie had to say goodbye to his sweet cousin  lily  last week! our family will always have fond memories of her running around the pool  trying to keep everyone in line. in the last year  she finally realized our family was not easily corraled. now you have thousand of pools to run around  lil  and millions of angels to herd. you will be missed!.gia  leah  gina  sara  laura  and sweet lily!.sign up for louie’s mailing list..categories be authentic  fear and pride  fundamentals in leadership  healthy culture  honesty  moral compromise  people process differently  relationships  the louie model  the paws model  transparency  trust  truth tags #danisedistasi  #louiesleadershiplessons  #pridegetsintheway  #toughlessons  danise distasi 2 comments.subscribe to blog via email.enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email..email address	.search for:.recent posts.time to say goodbye may 22  2020.when the world was silent may 14  2020.back to normal?

stopped to stare at louie as he proudly pranced by. we exchanged hellos  and she smiled at lou and said  “he’s such a good boy.” i just laughed and nodded..he looked at me and i at him  and i thought  “he is a pretty good dog.” but then i continued that conversation in my head: “well  most of the time. i mean  sometimes  he can be a bit  well  let’s just say mischievous.” quite honestly  he is a totally different dog than he was during our first few months together..louie’s transformation was no accident—i was very intentional in making changes in my life and my leadership style  and it took a lot of work..the one thing.but the most transformative power in our journey together was my decision to be a loving person and to pour love into little louie. i saw a significant difference in his behavior a few months into our time together and continue to see today  four years later!.sadly  the word “love” receives eye rolls and shoulder shrugs. the word gets tossed around frequently these days in every circle that wants to claim it is the most loving. we see countless hateful facebook posts and counter posts on how we need to love. over four years ago  in my first louie’s leadership lessons blog post  i took a chance and wrote about showing lou unconditional love  knowing how the world viewed the “l-word”  especially in the workplace. yet as we conduct more and more louie speeches and workshops  one thing that is always consistent is the total misunderstanding of the word love..a few months after my blog post on love  harvard business review published a study demonstrating that employees perform better when they feel loved. the study made a distinction between friendship love and romantic love  mainly that friendship love is based on warmth  affection  and connection rather than passion. the study revealed  “it is the small moments between coworkers—a warm smile  a kind note  a sympathetic ear—day after day  month after month  [danise’s note: on a consistent basis] that help create and maintain a strong culture of companion love and the employee satisfaction  productivity  and client satisfaction that comes with it.”.stop it and why!.so here’s my challenge to you today: stop training and coaching your staff in hopes of seeing change. be the leader who genuinely loves! unless you’re capable of showing authentic love to others  you will most likely cultivate a very toxic culture within your organization  family  and community. don’t confuse being nice with demonstrating love. they are two different qualities. love is a heart issue!.on the flip side  my observation has been that bosses who try to manufacture these qualities but demonstrate behavior to the contrary engender fear and mistrust among their employees..the how.may i be so bold as to take this a step further? i think it is virtually impossible to feel joy or experience peace in your life if you’re incapable of true genuine love. most of us do not understand love. so let me help you. here’s the tip of the iceberg of what i’ve been learning over four years of studying and blogging about louie and love:.love is an alignment of the whole self toward what is good and right..love must be aimed at and practiced. it takes work; as martin luther king  jr.  said  “it takes strength to love.”.love is not turned on and turned off for this person or for that it is consistently who you are..to demonstrate love  be a person possessed by love  so that you can go to an adversary as a loving person rather than going to an adversary and then trying to love that person..love arises out of a pure heart..love is directed toward what is good and right from the depths of ourselves  from which actions come..if we take care of the sources of actions  the actions will take care of themselves..love itself is patient  kind  trustworthy  true; not prideful  doesn’t hold on to grudges and is humble. we are to pursue love  and the rest takes care of itself..seek what is best and what is true. truth is sometimes very hard to share and to hear. yet many times  it is the most loving aspect of a genuine relationship..love is not something you choose to do but what or who you choose to be..look for the sources of malice in yourself and focus efforts upon grace to change them..malice is rooted in how we think of people—as objects—with little understanding of who they are or the difficulties they may have experienced in their lives..finally  love is the willingness to serve others for the greater good  above our own wants..there’s no way you can be patient with others  show kindness  have integrity  be faithful to your word  be gentle  or exhibit self-control without love. all of these excellent characteristics are rooted in love. and as leaders  we must be people of love  not just doers of nice things. check your motives and your hearts..where transformation truly begins.it wasn’t easy for me to show consistent  genuine love to louie. and it has been even more difficult to show love to people who are unlovable  demanding  or different from me—or those who have disappointed me. but i know what true love is  and i stand amazed that god so loves me! who am i to withhold that love from people who may need it most?.i chose louie  difficult personality and all. granted  we usually do not get to choose those we are commanded to love in the workplace. but people in your space could be transformed because you choose to love them..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  fear and pride  forgiveness

settling into our nightly routine  he became restless. he rarely dances around to signal his need to go outside; when he did so  we made it to the front yard just in the nick of time. he clearly had an upset stomach and was one miserable little pup..i wasn’t sure how he would fare through the night  but i knew he would let me know if he needed to make a trip outside. sure enough  at midnight and then again at 1:30 a.m.  he woke me up  needing to go out. i was administering the proper foods to settle his digestive system  but i had already decided to call the vet in the morning to get him in as soon as possible..then something magical happened. it’s tough to put the words “magical” and “upset stomach” in the same sentence  but that is exactly what took place. while i was thinking through all the practical reasons louie was sick and slowly trying to coax him back into the house  he stopped and looked far off into the distance. normally  louie can become nervous when he’s outside in the dark; he usually wants to head back inside as soon as possible. our trainer has advised me that i need to walk boldly and with confidence when we’re outside after dark so that louie will feel safe..but standing outside at 1:30 in the morning  i had no desire to be the alpha. i just wanted to go back to bed with a hope and a prayer that louie would be on the mend. at the moment  though  louie was fixated on something that grabbed his attention; even with a slight tug  he would not move..then it happened. rather than scurrying back to the safety of the house  we stood and took in the magic of a peaceful  quiet night. he slowly looked from the street up to the stars above. i stopped  too  and looked. the sky was beautiful  and the quietness with a few faint nighttime sounds was breathtaking. louie seemed to marvel at the night sky. i noticed it  too—and it grabbed my heart..we spent a long moment drinking in the beauty. i looked at my pup  and we both knew it was time to go in. after our midnight reverie  whatever louie tapped into must have healed his nerves because he settled in for a long  deep sleep. the next day  he woke up without a trace of sickness..as i type out this message  i am compelled to ponder this thought: when did i lose this sense of wonder? i see it emerge when i play with my grandchildren—when we go off on adventures. but as louie and i stood together that evening  i realized that it can be easy to mistake wonder for foolishness. in fact  i have to ask myself—is this thought just foolishness?.i so desire to reignite my sense of incredible marvel. for me  this is about more than being creative: it is seeing the beauty and magic in the world all around us—the creation that god breathed life into. it is engaging with a dear friend in deep  heartwarming conversation. it is watching my beautiful niece walk along a peaceful garden path to join her soon-to-be-husband in their outdoor wedding ceremony. it is witnessing the miraculous birth of my grandchildren. it is running outside to catch the ice cream truck as it passes through my neighborhood—and having my brother and his family joining me  which happened just last week. four adults standing in my driveway eagerly anticipating the thrill of eating ice cream from a truck  unprompted by children!.admit it—we yearn to be moved by seeing things beyond our physical world filled with horrific news. we all want to feel profoundly alive  to feel like we’re a part of the grander scheme of things for the greater good. yet many of us have lost this sense of curiosity. moments that might have taken our breath away from our younger selves now may not move us at all..if you are a leader in an organization  community  or family  what are ways you could reignite your sense of wonder? perhaps you feel aware that you’ve lost it  or perhaps you still do experience it. what about those you lead—do you see glimpses of their capacity for awe? the greatest gift you can give to others is to help them navigate uncertain waters and enter that new world with them. you can choose to intentionally engage in conversations with your team about recapturing this magical sense. you and your team may be surprised by feeling powerfully impacted as you tap into this sense..i hope louie never loses his sense of wonder. i am not saying that he has this down  or even that he is cognizant of his tender sense of awe. nevertheless  i envy his ability to stop and connect with creation and draw from that a sense of peace. even on that night without sleep  unexpected and moving lessons were shown to me by my pup  louie..********.if you recall my blogs at the beginning of the year  i had a life-changing event take place. my goal then was to dance at my niece’s wedding…and dance we did!.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  conflict  consistency  courage  dreams  fundamentals in leadership  healthy culture  honesty  leadership  lifelong

passed. every time we walk by sammy’s home  louie will check out the stake in the ground and attached leash or scope out a lingering smell that i’m sure reminds him of his friend. i can’t help but wonder what he remembers and what he thinks as he looks toward sammy’s front door. does he wonder why he hasn’t seen his friend in a while  or does he somehow know sammy won’t be coming out to play? he seems satisfied with the little reminders of sammy as we move on with our walk..i know louie has a great memory because of all the issues we’ve dealt with over the years in getting him to think differently about people coming to the door  the smell of cigars  or other triggers. i’m sure he remembers sammy prancing outside to play  allie greeting him with lots of kisses  and khaki regally sitting atop the hill  waiting for sir louie to arrive. the little reminders of his friends who have passed on seem to fill louie’s heart and spirit with joy and fondness..sometimes we humans tend to rush right past those reminders because we don’t want to dwell in the past  or it may be too painful to park there a moment. but they are nestled in our memories and  many times  those reminders are necessary for our well-being..i recently visited my brother and his family in phoenix and had the pleasure of bringing my granddaughter evi with me. what a joy! in addition to the beauty of arizona  we really enjoyed visiting mark  agnes  and christian. more times than not i would look across the table at evi and swear i was looking at her mother  my daughter  marisa. mark and i both caught ourselves calling evi by the endearing name my family calls marisa—rissy!.what sparked this thirty-year lapse in memory? the twinkle in evi’s eyes  her contagious laugh  the way she holds her hand up to her mouth as she tells a story  her facial expressions  and her tone of voice. her face alone is a replica of marisa’s—oh  the little reminders..but it goes deeper. i see my mom in so many ways when i look at marisa and evi! and when mea  my youngest granddaughter  crinkles her nose when she laughs  i see a glimpse of my mom who did the same thing. all these reminders fill my heart with lifelong memories. those memories open the door to a better understanding of the wisdom that has been passed down through the years. i hear my mom’s voice as i am reminded of the life lessons i’ve learned that have been passed to my daughter and now to her daughters—wisdom like this:.you can do whatever you’d like as long as you understand the consequences and are willing to face them (i wish i would have listened to that wisdom a bit more carefully)..you don’t need a thousand friends (and this before facebook). you do need a few good close friends (two to four) with whom you can trust and share life..look people in the eyes; show them they matter..never be so upset with someone that you won’t say hello (a kind and genuine hello) to him or her in public..family matters..whether across the table in phoenix or every time my brothers and sisters share funny stories of our youth with my granddaughters  evi and mea  i see my mom and i hear her voice. through such small and seemingly irrelevant reminders  my heart soars to the heights of a lifelong memory of my mother. i have been blessed that my mom spent significant time with marisa before she passed. and now i am blessed to share life with my daughter and grandchildren and to watch marisa blossom into a wonderful  loving mother..yes  i am sure louie relishes the little reminders of his dear friends who have passed on  and it must bring him joy as he taps into a lifelong memory. i see the joy by the way he walks and even in his face. and i have to smile every time i know louie is enjoying a wonderful memory..don’t rush by the little reminders that pop up in the daily haste to the next thing. you’ll be missing a soul refresher  a spark of a wonderful  lifelong memory. and in our hurried world  we all need these refreshing little reminders..happy mother’s day to all the moms making memories (doggie moms included)..mick reminding louie it is good to slow down!.for louie’s faithful friends…thank you!!.louie’s

10  2017 by danisedistasi.today was the first day i was able to wrap my arms around louie and give him a huge bear hug. it was three weeks ago that i had an accident and our lives quickly changed. and in celebrating my ability to hug him and receive an under the neck snuggle from him  i thought it fitting to resume our blog after an unintentionally extended vacation..december 18  2016  was filled with great anticipation. it was one week before christmas  and the distasi family was planning to gather at my house to celebrate christmas. everything was set; the massive amounts of food  the decorations  gifts  and music. it was to be a celebration to top all the ones we had celebrated so far as a family..louie and i took our usual stroll early that morning. two days before  there had been a late evening ice storm  but this particular morning seemed okay as far as icy pavement was concerned. still  i was cautious and walked in the grass as much as possible..an elderly neighbor has a very long driveway  and louie and i had been taking her daily newspaper to her so she would not have to venture out and lean over to pick it up. as soon as i stepped on the driveway  my feet flew up in the air  and i landed on my left hip. i lost control of louie  and it took me a few moments to catch my breath. i couldn’t see louie  and panic was about to set in. his normal reaction when something startles him is to run away. and seeing his mama flying through the air had to have been startling..i forced myself to turn as far to the left as i could. there louie sat  close behind my left shoulder. i reached around to draw him close to me. as he tucked his head under my arm  i felt his shaking and heard him whimper. to hear him cry broke my heart  and my tears started to flow uncontrollably. i knew i could not move—and whatever would take place from that moment forward  it would be a long journey. louie chose to stay by me as the faithful friend that he is..a neighbor pulled up with his phone in hand  already calling 911  and i called my friend and neighbor cindy to pick up louie. i called my daughter  marisa  and the network of community  family  and friends jumped into action. everyone’s life was interrupted on december 18  2016..after a jarring ambulance ride  surgery to repair a femur that was fractured in two places  a total hip replacement  five days in the hospital  and physical therapy  i was released to marisa and matt’s home for respite care and to celebrate christmas with the two cutest nurses on the face of the earth. louie had been well taken care of by my wonderful neighbors who had walked him  let him stay in their homes  taken him to daycare to play  and given him more love than he could imagine..life interrupted has taught louie and me a few things:.we appreciate life and the little things: although that seems so cliché  it was the small steps of accomplishment that filled me with joy. every day  i set new goals to accomplish—goals i never would have dreamed to set before. for instance  i learned to get out of bed  to go to the bathroom  and to take my meds without having to wake my daughter to help me. and to carry a cup of coffee in the morning to enjoy my quiet time. mea and evi helped me do things as they watched me improve. christmas had a deeper meaning this year with sincere thankfulness  love  and joy!.you really do know who your friends are: so many people dropped everything to help. it was a terrible strain on marisa and matt as they took care of me. so many friends offered to grocery shop  run errands  and stay with me when i finally came home. my sisters and cousin packed their clothes and took turns staying overnight. my brothers were calling  visiting  and bringing food. the neighbors who took care of louie were such godsends. many people could not help because of logistics  but they checked in and prayed..you have to move out of your comfort zone: this was a tough one for louie and me. i had to let people help me. what a humbling position to be in; i was helpless. i have never stayed in a hospital other than to give birth. i don’t take any medicines  and i have never fractured a single bone. the outpouring of love and encouragement has been overwhelming. louie had to be comfortable with people coming and going in and out of our home and driving him to and from daycare. but we both pressed on through pain  frustration  fear  and being uncomfortable. it was difficult  but i believe we made it past the hardest part of this process. there’s still much more healing to take place and there will always be a next move out of our comfort zone. i have no doubt we’ll press through that too..some things just do not matter: the superficiality of the holidays clashed with the richness of genuine  loving relationships. there can be no comparison of the things that are bought with the things that are sought  caught  and taught. the characteristics of love  joy  and peace are important for us to live and pass on to others. it takes effort  but it is worth the time and effort. i am a better person because of the love  joy  and peace that others shared with me this season..2017 is going to be a great year of love and strength. louie is a better dog because he chose faithfulness over running away. he trusted and allowed others into his world to help us! we are closer because of these last few weeks. thank you to so many for being in my life and for your prayers and support!.click here to sign up for louie’s email list..categories balance of

decided to to do an extended blog  introducing our louie leadership model..our story began three years ago in the rolling hills of boyd county  kentucky—a place i never knew existed. it’s your typical love story: boy meets girl  boy woos girl with his charming ways and big brown eyes  girl is swept off her feet  and they fall in love and live happily ever after. except in this story  the boy is an adopted puppy named louie..although i have a tremendous amount of leadership experience  i never truly understood leadership until i met this little guy..our blog  and my soon-to-be-released third book  louie’s leadership lessons  are compilations of time-tested leadership models  heart-warming stories of courage and love  and techniques for overcoming common issues such as pride  fear  and doubt—all illustrated by eye-opening experiences with my rescue dog. the time i spent with him and his trainer was life changing..this extended blog is the introduction to our new book and contains nuggets of wisdom i’ve learned over the decades about leadership and the gift of relationships with a fresh perspective renewed by louie’s point of view..i have distilled all louie has taught me into a leadership model that is easy to remember and easy to follow. when you have a leadership dilemma  ask yourself  “what would louie do?” the answer is in his name: louie..love.louie was either lost or abandoned in kentucky and made his way to cincinnati  where i live  through a number of shelters. although i love dogs  i had decided not to get another one for many reasons—that is  until i just happened to stop by petsmart while they were conducting an adopt-a-pet weekend and encountered this abandoned mutt with big brown. i tossed my concerns aside  brought him home  and named him louie distasi. i soon discovered that louie had brought a lot of emotional baggage to the relationship. he demonstrated behaviors that deeply concerned me  and i engaged a dog trainer to help address them. i quickly realized i needed training as much as louie did  if not more so..i’m not afraid of tough lessons  and i’m always looking for ways to improve my leadership skills. but working with louie was challenging. the bottom line was that louie needed acceptance  consistency  discipline  and—above all—unconditional love. i wasn’t sure i was equipped to provide all that..when i first met louie  he was very sweet and subdued in his crate. several hours after we arrived home  he became much more active. i loved louie when he was a good little dog  but i didn’t love him so much when he started to act out and behaved badly when people came to the door  etc. it was a struggle  and i had to make a choice to love him. i decided to commit to loving this abandoned pup  in spite of his baggage..employees can be like louie. they bring a lot of baggage to the job and may be hard to love at times. one of the most critical needs for any human being is the need to feel loved. all of us have this innate desire  yet it is one of the most difficult to fulfill. c. s. lewis said it best:.“to be loved but not known is comforting but superficial. to be known and not loved is our greatest fear. but to be fully known and truly loved is  well  a lot like being loved by god. it is what we need more than anything. it liberates us from pretense  humbles us out of our self-righteousness  and fortifies us for any difficulty life can throw at us.”.love is not merely a warm fuzzy feeling; love in action is the aspect that is important in leadership. when i mention the word “love” in the workplace  i receive a tremendous amount of pushback. people say  “don’t bring it up; you’ll have hr issues.” i question whether people understand what love really means..while employees can be hard to love at times (maybe most of the time)  it is still your choice to love or be indifferent toward them. let’s look at the characteristics of leaders who love:.they are patient..they are kind..they honor other people..they are honest..they are protective..they are trustworthy..they are always hopeful..they persevere through difficult situations..they are other seeking and other serving..they manage their emotions well..of course  there are also things that they are not:.they aren’t envious..they aren’t boastful..they aren’t prideful..they don’t keep records of wrongs..the characteristics of loving leaders are those that leaders should display when they are working with their people—baggage and all. that’s what love in action looks like..servant leaders are those who display the characteristics above. they are humble enough to serve and strong enough to lead..objectives and goals.the next thing i learned in the course of training louie was that  as a leader  i needed clear objectives and plans for how to achieve them. this is true with our teams at work  as well. objectives must be clear and specific. they have to be trackable. they have to be relevant. they have to be attainable and motivating..i engaged a trainer who taught me that my first goal in this journey with louie was to establish my role as leader. yep—i actually had to learn how to be louie’s alpha. i wrongly assumed he would know i was in charge because i’m bigger than him  i own the house  i pay for the meals. assuming is a mistake many leaders make. throughout our blog  you’ll read the importance of objectives and goals with each lesson i learned through louie..understanding.another lesson i learned was to truly understand that louie had “stuff” in his background. fear and anxiety issues were at the top of the list. these may have come from abandonment or abuse—it’s hard to say. but it is not unlike everyone we meet  whether he or she is on our team  or just a person whose path we crossed in the grocery store. every human being needs to feel loved and valued. it is our innermost need  and it was this little dog’s need as well. he had never had a sense of being valued in his life  and he needed to know that someone cared about him. i had to understand louie’s struggles to love him  which would enable me to set clear objectives and goals for our journey together. i needed to understand louie’s issues. it wasn’t easy to get past some of them. they were real and profound..as leaders  we need to take the time to understand our people. we need to realize that there’s always something about a person’s circumstances that we don’t know  and before we judge people  we need to try to understand them..when you run into an issue with someone and your first inclination is to become upset  try the paws method to help you analyze the situation before doing something you may regret:.pause…breathe! allow oxygen to get to your brain..ask the person questions: “what’s going on?” “can you tell me more?” “help me understand.” “is everything ok?” ask yourself questions: “why does this aggravate me?”.use wisdom. choose your words wisely. i would much rather have people feel uncomfortable waiting for me to find the right words than i ever would with words that could be hurtful..seek to understand. once you pause  ask questions  and choose your words wisely  you will naturally seek to understand. remember  everyone has “stuff” in his or her backgrounds. and so do you!.as leaders  we need to make an effort to understand. take time to understand your people and avoid making assumptions. throughout this blog  there are many lessons relating to how i learned to understand louie  who could not verbally communicate with me. these lessons will help you understand how others communicate and process ideas differently than you do—and that’s ok..investment.i then learned to invest my time and talent into developing louie. we should ask ourselves  “how much time do we invest in our teams? our families? our friends?” take the time to get to know people and invest in them..this picture breaks my heart. this is louie the first night he came home with me. he curled up in the corner  scared and alone. i put a pillow next to him to provide some comfort. louie now sleeps in a very open bed in my bedroom because he feels safe with me  and i with him. i chose to invest a tremendous amount of time in louie so that he could learn to trust and love me. it took time. everything takes time. you cannot go wrong by investing your time getting to know people. take them out to lunch. ask them questions. this point relates back to understanding. it links to feeling valued  and it relates to feeling loved. take time to gather information. you never know what you can uncover when you give your time..there are many suggestions for  and examples of  investing in others throughout our blog. get to know people  spend time with them  share your talents and your skill set; put effort into your relationships with people because you want to give without receiving anything in return. i can guarantee that if you are a leader  and you do this  your team will be more productive  creative  and effective. it is the foundation for a healthy culture. invest your time..empowerment.the last step in my leadership training with louie was to empower him. empowering your team is essential  but it’s not simply letting people do whatever they want to do. empowering is taking the time to love them and establishing clear objectives and goals. it is understanding them  and investing in them. once you do these things  your people will be empowered to use their gifts and talents to do their jobs; and in doing so  you empower them to be the people god created them to be—not who you think they should be. they will be loved and valued..louie is an entirely different dog today because i love him. i took the time to set up a development plan and was clear about objectives and goals for him to be a good  healthy dog and for us to enjoy a relationship together. i had to understand his needs. i had to understand his background. i had to figure out what was going on with him. i invested time  my skill set  and other people’s skill sets to help develop him. he is empowered to be a fun-loving  free little dog..my work with louie is not unlike leading our teams. transformation occurs when we apply the louie leadership model: love  objectives  understanding  investment  and empowerment  as well as the paws model: pause  ask  wisdom  and seek. throughout louie’s leadership lessons  you will see more examples of these two models wrapped in stories of love  struggles  and immense joy..while it brings me great pleasure to know that louie is a transformed dog  i am the one who has been profoundly changed into a better leader because of the lessons i’ve learned from my experiences with him. we look forward to continuing our journey with you through our

you doing what you’ve been created to do?.march 15  2016 march 16  2016 by danisedistasi.a few weeks ago during a beautiful  spring-like day  louie and i took a long  quick-paced walk. as we headed into the homestretch  we slowed  and louie stopped to investigate a grassy area. suddenly he took three hops and then pounced on a tunnel that clearly contained a live mole running for its life just a few inches underground..louie was unstoppable. with his long snout he dug  snorted  clawed  and tore away chunks of grass. i was amazed as i watched him and could only imagine the mole’s heart racing as it made its way under a fence to safety. louie made it clear that no mole is safe in his neighborhood. and with that he turned  puffed out his chest  and pranced away..i’ve never seen louie hop  but the bounce in his step and the sheer determination in his hot pursuit of the mole made me smile. rather than walk away in defeat  he strutted off knowing he did exactly what he was created to do—hunt moles..as we walked i wondered about being created for a purpose. louie instinctively knows to track a scent  and nothing deters him once he is on one. but what about you as a leader or those you lead? are you doing what you were created to do? are you providing the environment for your direct reports to do what they’ve been created to do? very few people do  and you immediately recognize those who are: the speaker who captivates you till the end  the author who unlocks a truth deep within  the woodworker who takes your breath away with his talent  the businesswoman who builds a relationship while providing the exact solution needed  and the teacher who watches another class graduate..yet so many times people are placed in roles because a function needs to be filled. the frustration builds when a particular position is not at all what that person was designed to do. for instance  a company just lost its vice president of sales. the organization already has a successful account manager  and due to budget and time constraints  management decides to promote this employee into the role. it is unlikely that the account manager will be successful because he or she may not be a hunter or is uncomfortable going after a deal. most account managers prefer to nurture accounts  follow a process  and assist customers with their experience. as a result  sales will suffer and the new vice president  once thriving and successful  will suffer as well..once we recognize that we aren’t doing what we were created to do  we may feel a prolonged level of dissatisfaction. that’s when it is time to take stock and make changes:.listen to your gut. we’ve heard that intuition or following our heart gets us into trouble  but most of the time  there is a reason for that gnawing feeling that something is just not right. listen to it and investigate; dig around to find out what’s causing these feelings..listen to and watch others. i remember the movie chariots of fire  about the olympic runner eric liddell  who explains to his sister  “i believe god made me for a purpose  but he also made me fast. and when i run i feel his pleasure.” as you see others light up and recognize their purpose  take note of the times you have felt a high level of energy when you were doing a certain task..passion is another way to understand what you were created for. there are certain issues that fire you up. even as you read this  you can think of one or two. take the necessary next step to get involved in such causes. don’t let the uncertainty of the second step keep you from taking the first step.*.what are you gifted in? what do people ask you for help with? what drains you  and what gives you energy? recognize that the life-giving activities are the ones you were created to do..the good news is that we were all created for a purpose  and we all have different purposes. once we understand what we are created for  life becomes so much more rewarding. imagine yourself as a leader helping those around you find their purpose..be aware-not everyone will appreciate your purpose or calling. i’ve blogged about the dream slayers in our lives. this is very similar. there are people who would rather have mole tunnels and rows of dead grass in their yard than a hound dog burrowing his nose in the ground. i recently gave a speech and challenged people to assess the lies in their life that cause them to hide behind a façade. not everyone wants to face that challenge. i’ve been called to help women be strong  bold and humble without being pushy  rude or weak. achieving that balance means first addressing the lie that knocked us off kilter..as for my little buddy louie—he is not a retriever; he’s a hunter. he is in his element when he hunts moles. he can pick up the scent of a mole several yards away. although i am really proud of his ability to scare them away  i don’t want to know what on earth he will do if he actually catches one. stay tuned!.* henry blackaby.out  damned mole! out  i say!.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  forgiveness  fundamentals in leadership

friends.february 23  2016 february 24  2016 by danisedistasi.i’ve written about louie’s new gal pals moving into the neighborhood  louie’s getting to know rambunctious puppies  and his tolerance (or occasional intolerance) of guests in our home. you’ve been introduced to his chest-bumping pal  mick  his walking buddy sully and his steady girls eve and ellie. but we’ve not talked about sampson much. that’s because there’s not much to talk about. sampson (or sammy) is just a steady as you go  no drama kind of pup. and louie loves that because louie needs steady and stable..louie and sammy met a few years ago. sampson is an adorable pug who is occasionally stubborn while walking with his mom. but louie rarely sees that side of sammy. the pups happily acknowledge each other and then just walk side by side. sammy waddles  louie prances  and the pace seems to work for them both..lou can be who he is when he’s with sampson. he can just simply be. it’s almost as though he lets out a long sigh and says  “hey buddy.” and then they just walk together. they don’t romp around or chase each other. they just stroll..while i have many friends and family members who love me just as i am  my lifetime friend gina has known me since the day i was born. our parents were friends long before we came along and despite their moving to l.a. when gina and i were three  our parents remained friends and my friendship with gina deepened over the years. to this day  gina and i talk regularly and visit as often as possible..the best thing about gina is that i can be my authentic self with her. i don’t have to perform or jump through hoops or pretend or walk on egg shells. i learned about the power of vulnerability decades ago because my friendship with gina helped me see the areas in my life that kept me from being real. it wasn’t a book or a training session or a counselor  although those are great tools. it was the power of relationship that brought me to where i am today..much like louie and sampson  gina and i don’t have to be talking to feel close and can simply bask in the golden silence of true friendship. we have shared life’s sorrows including death of loved ones  divorce  remarriage and we’ve shared life’s joys such as the birth of each other’s children. we can call at 3 a.m. and one of us will answer the phone with  “what’s wrong?” we’ve been through sickness  job promotions  sixty birthdays and many kauai sunsets. through thick and thin  we will always be best friends..i know gina loves me enough to address a character flaw she may see in me long before others do. i trust her to be honest and caring  so i welcome her feedback. some leaders think they are above feedback but without it  they can end up with negative consequences that affect their relationships as well as their job performance. we all need friends in our lives who act as a stopgap to our bad behavioral choices. and we must be willing to listen..every leader needs a gina! and every leader needs to hear when their gina says  “i’m not sure about that.” just as every louie needs a sampson  a steady as you go  let’s walk side by side pal who cares more about you than they do themselves. these kinds of friends truly enrich our lives and make us better people  leaders…or pets!.me and gina (left)  1956 (and my sister donna 🙂.me and gina–still crazy after all these

uh  you lookin’ at me?”.she then stands a little taller and looks down at him as if to say  “what are you talking about? you’re lookin’ at me!” he puffs his chest out and she pushes her nose at him  and before you know it they are huffing and puffing and challenging one another. with a slight tug on his leash and my usual command to “leave it ” we continue on our walk..now these two have had great interactions before  and  based on louie’s body language and tone of voice  he’s not aggressively challenging her. but i find it interesting that his bad behavior provokes her bad behavior and  if allowed  it may escalate to a more serious challenge..i noticed this too with his little buddy  mac. louie typically ignores him  but when mac is unusually “active ” louie seems to chime right in and become an obnoxious pup by playing rough (with me  not another dog) or ignoring me when it is time to settle down..our work teams are very similar. although a smile or a word of affirmation from a coworker can spread good cheer in the workplace  bad behavior and rudeness are also contagious. being rude or impolite to your coworkers can lead them to behave the same way  negatively affecting our culture and productivity..as leaders  rudeness should not be tolerated in our work or homes. while there may be many reasons for someone to be in a bad mood and react negatively  it is our responsibility as leaders to demonstrate that even under unpleasant circumstances it is never okay to be rude and disrespectful. so what are we to do?.it seems the “leave it” command works well for louie  and it works well for me  too. “leave it” doesn’t mean to ignore the situation and hope it goes away. it simply means to not dwell on it and let the emotion subside. oswald chambers  an early twentieth-century scottish theologian and teacher  said over a century ago  “there is always at least one more fact  which we know nothing about  in every person’s situation.”.this is a good time to revisit the paws method. when someone is rude and your first inclination is to become upset and respond rudely  try this method to help you analyze the situation before doing something you may regret:.pause—breathe! allow oxygen to get to your brain. you may need to walk away for a bit and then revisit the situation. there is power in the pause. when we pause before speaking  we gain time to process our thoughts..ask questions: “what’s going on?” “can you tell me more?” “can you help me understand?” “is everything okay?” ask yourself these things: is there something else going on in this person’s life? what’s going on with me? why does this aggravate me? reflect on your answers before you speak..wisdom: choose your words wisely. i would much rather have people feel uncomfortable waiting for me to find the right words than allowing myself to get sucked into poor behavior. carefully consider the words you are about to say. if they are not life-giving  do not say them. nothing good comes from useless  mindless words..seek to understand: once you pause  ask questions  and choose your words wisely  you will naturally seek to understand. remember  everyone has “stuff” in his or her backgrounds. and so do you!.there is no reason to tolerate rudeness in our workplace  and studies have shown that bad behavior begets bad behavior. we have a responsibility as leaders to stop that behavior in order to maintain or restore a healthy culture..as for louie and his beautiful tall cool blonde friend  i think they may secretly like each other. i may have to help him a bit with showing girls his interest. so far he’s not scoring any points  but i still love him..my bad little dog  talented as he may be. he actually pulled a towel out of the laundry basket and somehow wrapped himself in it and settled in for a nap!.click here to sign up for louie’s emails.through lessons learned from a well-loved rescue pup  a leadership model emerges that makes the connection to relationships  revealing the small ways leaders can empower their teams every day..click the image for information on how to order louie’s leadership lessons.louie’s leadership lessons are lovingly fed by….categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  ending well  fear and pride  forgiveness  fundamentals in leadership  gossip  healthy culture  honesty  leadership  relationships  respect  the louie model  transparency  trust  truth tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  distasi advisors  healthy cultures  healthy relationships  love  realational leadership leave a comment.will you please stop whining.february 6  2017 february 7  2017 by danisedistasi.a passing thought drifted through my mind the other day: i will miss all the love and attention i have received over the past few weeks. but since i would rather hear “wow  you’re doing so well” than “oh  gee  sorry you’re still struggling with your recovery ” the thought passed quickly  never to return..because i’m ready to close the chapter on my accident and subsequent surgery  my passing thought is not what the subject line is referring to. this is a blog about my persnickety pup louie and his ever-increasing need to whine. while i know he suffered trauma over the past couple of months along with me  his whining seems to have increased exponentially rather than to have subsided as i would have expected. i soon discovered his behavior has nothing to do with my injury. instead  louie is reacting to a new dog in the neighborhood..this new dog represents everything louie hates. the dog is a male  he’s bigger than lou  and he’s . . . shhhh . . . not neutered. the last issue sends louie into a tizzy even before we walk out the door. his hackles go up  and he puffs out his chest and huffs as he walks out. but then the incessant whining begins. and once he starts that  it’s tough to get him to stop..one morning as we exited the garage  we made a sharp left turn out of our driveway and hurried away from where the dog lives as quickly as a girl with a cane can manage. louie looked back  whined  and seemed disoriented. i tugged on his collar and gave a stern command  “leave it ” which he immediately obeyed  but his memory is keen  and it quickly took him back to the dark side. i was hoping he would find a new smell to distract him..thanks to zig our dog trainer  i learned a long time ago that louie whines out of fear  so i have to step up and walk with confidence. that’s tough to do considering i’m still healing  but i did the best i could. louie suspiciously eyed the cane  and then looked back at me with a face that said he was not convinced i could protect us both . . . and i didn’t blame him..as our walk settled into a more relaxed pace  i reflected on why some people  like louie  seem to whine so much. do you have a few whiners on your team? it’s easy to get frustrated and dismiss them  but there is usually something deeper going on that we may never uncover unless we take the time to do so..fear is a big issue for louie  which is why he whines. fear is a big issue for people as well and could be the reason some folks whine. i have learned to counter louie’s fear  not with my confidence but with love. love is the first step of the louie leadership model:.love is foundational to building trust and integrity for a personal or professional relationship to flourish. without love and trust  our relationships are like fragile shells that have nothing inside of them and with the slightest amount of pressure  are easily shattered. because of the love i have demonstrated for louie on a regular basis  he has learned to trust me. [for more on leading with trust  see this article by my friend  randy conley  vice president of client services & trust practice leader for the ken blanchard companies.].a teammate may whine because the team is experiencing a daunting and uncomfortable change. loving people through such change does not mean we coddle them. it means we shed light on the situation  we share the truth  and we press through together..love is more impactful than complaining to others that someone is a whiner..our society tends to misuse the word love. in fact  very few understand the strength and character it takes to love others. we have fluffy commercials about it  emoticons  and facebook posts. martin luther king  jr. said  “darkness cannot drive out darkness  only light can do that. hate cannot drive out hate  only love can do that.”.and who can argue with this verse: “such love has no fear because perfect love expels all fear. if we are afraid  it is for fear of punishment  and this shows that we have not fully experienced his (god’s) perfect love.”.i doubt louie will be able to love the new dog in the neighborhood anytime soon. in fact  i’m sure he is hoping the dog moves away. in the meantime  i’m working on loving lou through this ordeal and rebuilding his confidence and trust in me so he knows i will never allow another dog to threaten him..but louie is a dog and as humans  we can choose to love. you can be the change agent for someone by removing fear of punishment or detrimental consequences and instilling love instead. such love is the gateway to experiencing god’s perfect love and the cornerstone on which excellent and effective leadership is built..note: my friend t.d. hughes knows how emphatic i am about leadership and love and recently sent me an article i thought you would enjoy as well. it’s okay to love your employees.**speaking of love  louie sends his love for a wonderful valentine’s day**.picture compliments of louie’s favorite place  best

that means!.january 24  2017 january 24  2017 by danisedistasi.our last blog detailed a journey i’m glad to say i am more than halfway through. if all goes well  my release date from all restrictions is february 1  2017. i am off all pain medication  and i took my first solo drive yesterday. i am beginning to see some normalcy slowly trickle back into my life. again  i am completely humbled by the continued outpouring of love and encouragement. thank you!.and then  there’s louie! louie was as traumatized as i was through this journey. he had to adjust to my being gone for two weeks; friends coming and going  walking and feeding him  playing with him  all while he constantly watched the door with the hope i would walk through it any minute..now that i’m home and he’s learned to trust my erratic movements with a cane  he seems to have settled back into some interesting habits: growling at people who come to my door (even his dog walkers) and jumping on the couch to sit directly across from me (better to watch me  he says)..one evening  a friend came by to take louie for a walk. after they finished and she came in to sit with me for awhile  he ran into the house  checked on me  and then ran upstairs  where he ran the length of the hallway several times. then  i heard a big commotion  and from where i was sitting  i could tell what that little rascal was doing. he was getting into my clothesbasket in my bathroom and taking all the clothes out of it  having no consideration whatsoever for the amount of time it took me to get the clothes into that basket..his continued motion  which was evident even though he was a floor above me  indicated he not only removed the items from the basket  he was also rolling in them—all of them! some time ago  i explained to zig  our trainer  louie’s annoying bad habit of rolling in the dirty laundry. i assumed it was because he wanted to surround himself with my smell  weird as that is..but zig assured me that was not it at all. louie was getting his smell on my clothes  showing his dominance over me. what? now that is a really annoying bad habit that makes me realize we are back to square one. there will be no dominance of louie over me..but this is not surprising. when it takes all my energy to walk from the living room to the kitchen  disciplining a dog is not high on my list  especially since we’ve been through this before. the pressure was off of louie to behave well  and when the pressure is off  he reverts back to his old habits..that is so like us. a while ago  i wrote a blog about something i learned from my time with the ken blanchard companies about the dynamics of change. one dynamic is that when the pressure is off  we revert to our original behaviors. well  the pressure was definitely off  and louie was back to some of his old habits. we will need to spend time correcting that. but rather than lament  i reflected on what this means as far as my recent journey and getting “back to normal.”.finally being able to drive did give me a sense of life getting back to normal. getting off medication  walking better  and looking forward to some normalcy were great goals for recovery. but did i really want normalcy to be my goal?.not this time  not this year. i am going to be intentional (keeping the pressure on) about breaking past the norm to live a well-meaning life by doing the following:.pruning activities  objects  and even some relationships  all to devote precious time to what matters;.being kind in thought  word  and deed  whether people deserve it or not. i don’t mean just merely being nice (and sometimes superficial and phony)  but being authentic and loving—speaking truth in love and showing those who differ from me  or have differing viewpoints  the compassion that only comes from faith in god;.taking time to listen in order to learn—and not rushing to the next project;.being still and having plenty of margin in my life;.laughing more; and.dancing (okay  that one is normal for me  but now takes on an even more special meaning). i will take time to dance more with my grandchildren and even my adult daughter because that’s what distasi kids do. my niece sara is getting married in september  and she has promised we will dance the night away. that is my goal for 2017..be intentional about breaking past the norm. life is too short and too easily interrupted for us to stay stuck in the status quo. and you are never too old to take that first step to crashing through the “same ol’  same ol’.”.as for louie  we have some work to do. as i have been writing  he slipped into my laundry room and pulled out a dishtowel. he is so bad. i know he has a large fan base of people who love him  but this annoying little habit just makes me shake my head. i suppose being intentionally kind starts now with little louie distasi!.click the cover to order louie’s leadership legacy book..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble

danisedistasi.today was the first day i was able to wrap my arms around louie and give him a huge bear hug. it was three weeks ago that i had an accident and our lives quickly changed. and in celebrating my ability to hug him and receive an under the neck snuggle from him  i thought it fitting to resume our blog after an unintentionally extended vacation..december 18  2016  was filled with great anticipation. it was one week before christmas  and the distasi family was planning to gather at my house to celebrate christmas. everything was set; the massive amounts of food  the decorations  gifts  and music. it was to be a celebration to top all the ones we had celebrated so far as a family..louie and i took our usual stroll early that morning. two days before  there had been a late evening ice storm  but this particular morning seemed okay as far as icy pavement was concerned. still  i was cautious and walked in the grass as much as possible..an elderly neighbor has a very long driveway  and louie and i had been taking her daily newspaper to her so she would not have to venture out and lean over to pick it up. as soon as i stepped on the driveway  my feet flew up in the air  and i landed on my left hip. i lost control of louie  and it took me a few moments to catch my breath. i couldn’t see louie  and panic was about to set in. his normal reaction when something startles him is to run away. and seeing his mama flying through the air had to have been startling..i forced myself to turn as far to the left as i could. there louie sat  close behind my left shoulder. i reached around to draw him close to me. as he tucked his head under my arm  i felt his shaking and heard him whimper. to hear him cry broke my heart  and my tears started to flow uncontrollably. i knew i could not move—and whatever would take place from that moment forward  it would be a long journey. louie chose to stay by me as the faithful friend that he is..a neighbor pulled up with his phone in hand  already calling 911  and i called my friend and neighbor cindy to pick up louie. i called my daughter  marisa  and the network of community  family  and friends jumped into action. everyone’s life was interrupted on december 18  2016..after a jarring ambulance ride  surgery to repair a femur that was fractured in two places  a total hip replacement  five days in the hospital  and physical therapy  i was released to marisa and matt’s home for respite care and to celebrate christmas with the two cutest nurses on the face of the earth. louie had been well taken care of by my wonderful neighbors who had walked him  let him stay in their homes  taken him to daycare to play  and given him more love than he could imagine..life interrupted has taught louie and me a few things:.we appreciate life and the little things: although that seems so cliché  it was the small steps of accomplishment that filled me with joy. every day  i set new goals to accomplish—goals i never would have dreamed to set before. for instance  i learned to get out of bed  to go to the bathroom  and to take my meds without having to wake my daughter to help me. and to carry a cup of coffee in the morning to enjoy my quiet time. mea and evi helped me do things as they watched me improve. christmas had a deeper meaning this year with sincere thankfulness  love  and joy!.you really do know who your friends are: so many people dropped everything to help. it was a terrible strain on marisa and matt as they took care of me. so many friends offered to grocery shop  run errands  and stay with me when i finally came home. my sisters and cousin packed their clothes and took turns staying overnight. my brothers were calling  visiting  and bringing food. the neighbors who took care of louie were such godsends. many people could not help because of logistics  but they checked in and prayed..you have to move out of your comfort zone: this was a tough one for louie and me. i had to let people help me. what a humbling position to be in; i was helpless. i have never stayed in a hospital other than to give birth. i don’t take any medicines  and i have never fractured a single bone. the outpouring of love and encouragement has been overwhelming. louie had to be comfortable with people coming and going in and out of our home and driving him to and from daycare. but we both pressed on through pain  frustration  fear  and being uncomfortable. it was difficult  but i believe we made it past the hardest part of this process. there’s still much more healing to take place and there will always be a next move out of our comfort zone. i have no doubt we’ll press through that too..some things just do not matter: the superficiality of the holidays clashed with the richness of genuine  loving relationships. there can be no comparison of the things that are bought with the things that are sought  caught  and taught. the characteristics of love  joy  and peace are important for us to live and pass on to others. it takes effort  but it is worth the time and effort. i am a better person because of the love  joy  and peace that others shared with me this season..2017 is going to be a great year of love and strength. louie is a better dog because he chose faithfulness over running away. he trusted and allowed others into his world to help us! we are closer because of these last few weeks. thank you to so many for being in my life and for your prayers and support!.click here to sign up for louie’s email list..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and

expectancy.december 12  2016 december 13  2016 by danisedistasi.louie  my adopted pup  and i were walking on a beautiful fall day when we saw one of his pug buddies—or so we thought. his friend sammy is a tan and black pug with a unique characteristic: his tongue protrudes ever so slightly. i recognized that the person walking him was not his owner. that’s not unusual since many of us in the community need others to walk our dogs on occasion. louie was excited to see his buddy and could hardly wait to romp and play..as we approached  i asked if the dog was sammy  because he had the same markings and same characteristic of a slightly protruding tongue. the person walking him said no. but louie quickly ran up to the sammy look-alike; it did not take him long to realize this was not his buddy  and then he became indignant as if he was mad at the pug for not being sammy..we quickly said our good-byes while louie kicked up his feet and snarled just to make sure the dog understood he was not even close to being sammy..i realized louie’s expectations for playing with his friend were unmet  and disappointment had set in quickly. based on all appearances  louie was expecting to have fun and play  but that expectation was not to be filled that day..this time of year  the majority of us have many expectations that  when unmet for whatever reason  will disappoint us. people have a hard time moving on from such setbacks. i think these disappointments occur because we’ve set ourselves up for failure when we box up our expectations in the hopes that they will be fulfilled..instead  what if we had a spirit of expectancy? you may wonder what the difference is between having expectations and having a spirit of expectancy. a spirit of expectancy is what very young children usually possess. they have the mindset that something wonderful is about to happen  but with no expectation of specifics. while they may wish for something on their christmas list  it is their heart of expectancy that is truly magical. it is the hopefulness of something wonderful. for me  that may entail time with my family  but without expectation that the time meets any specific criteria—it is simply time together..another example occurred on the holiest of nights. for centuries  people expected the messiah to come amongst their midst. in this expectation  they envisioned a king  surrounded by throngs of noble men and women and trumpets blaring. because of these expectations they missed the wonder of all that took place on that quiet  serene night when the stars were brightly shining..yet only those with a spirit of expectancy  whose hearts were open to the wonder of what only the creator of the universe could put into action  witnessed the birth of the king in a simple  lowly manger..expectations for particular things and events always run the risk of disappointing us  since many times  events and what others do are out of our control. as we wind down our year  rather than focusing on the disappointments of unmet expectations  let’s look forward with a heart of expectancy and see if that doesn’t lighten our spirits with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen..while louie experienced disappointment by not having his expectations met with the look-alike sammy  it did not dampen his spirit of expectancy. he still walks out of our home with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen. something as simple as seeing a dear neighbor who pats him on the head or gives him belly rubs lends to his heart of wonder..click the image for

november 29  2016 by danisedistasi.the subject line might offend louie. in fact  it might offend you as well. but let’s face it—in the heat of the recent political battle  many of us are shaking our heads while trying to understand what just happened. one thing i do know is that disrespect for people with differing opinions is at an all-time high..the rude rhetoric on all sides of the political spectrum gave me pause and made me think of louie and some of his not-so-friendly foes. i am convinced that if people were to act the way our pets do  we would all get along better. for example  sometimes louie might see a dog that challenges him. the two will snarl and growl and perhaps even bark at each other. however  the minute we walk side by side with the dog and its owner  they seem to get along. there is something about being intentional and walking alongside someone you have a disagreement with..louie has done this with my niece’s dog  buddy. those two little boys will scrunch their noses  curl their lips  show their teeth  stand their hair up  and bark in such a high pitch that people turn their heads with a look of concern. andrea laughs  assuring everyone in sight that the dogs are actually cousins and are fine with each other. it sure doesn’t seem like it when they are facing one another. however  as soon as we start walking  they are fine together..louie also behaves this way with rambunctious claire  his other cousin noli  his neighbor snickers  and a new boxer in the community named socks. what is it about being side by side with their supposed nemesis? i think there are several things:.it is less threatening..they are on equal ground..they see the same vision of what lies ahead..they walk with the same pace..it is easier to carry the other’s burden. (okay  this one relates to humans  not louie.).what if some of our leaders were intentional about walking side by side instead of duking it out? i am reminded of an article i wrote in 2005 when i worked with ken blanchard titled “leading with your heart takes humility.” although it was written over eleven years ago  the premise holds true today: humility is the key to excelling in leadership. and servant leaders are humble enough to walk beside someone they disagree with..i won’t share the full article here (you can find it at this link)  but here are some of the highlights:.something is glaringly missing from leadership today. sadly  many leadership programs are missing just one key ingredient: the heart. not just the heart of the issue or the heart of the matter—the heart of the people..what gets in your way? what truly is your motive for being a leader or wanting to lead others? is it for selfish gain or to better others?.many times  our ego gets in the way and what bubbles up out of our hearts are things like pride  selfishness  and even fear..how can you push past what holds you back? in getting past the barriers  is the challenge as a leader to balance confidence with humility to fight ego issues? ken blanchard often uses the quote  “humility is not thinking less of yourself. it’s thinking of yourself less.” every time you make a leadership decision  are you thinking of yourself or others?.confidence does not come from being in a dominant position and leading by intimidation. doing this will cause you to lose respect from others  and any talk about values or integrity will be ignored. humility  however  is not something they teach us in business schools. it is a character trait that is honed over time with truth and love..our businesses  organizations  and families are hungry for leadership coupled with humility. it takes commitment to make the necessary changes to have a healthy culture and humble leaders..perhaps our world could learn a lesson from louie about being intentional and walking side by side with others rather than snarling at them. while louie doesn’t understand humility  his actions speak louder than his woof. he is more than willing to walk alongside others. as i watch his actions  i am convinced that we humans have much to learn from our dogs..louie’s newest revision is now available. click on the book to order..click

his face let me know he was not pleased. at all..“louie ” i said sternly as i tried to squeeze his 40 pounds of muscle where it didn’t want to go. “this is only for two hours  if that. surely you can oblige me.”.i sat back and stared at him  exasperated. for the last few halloweens  i’ve donned a cruella de vil look and spent the evening with my grandchildren. this year i thought it would be fun to take louie along in a dalmatian outfit. except there were no dalmatian costumes for dogs. the closest thing i could find was a child’s costume for a spotted cow..i had imagined how it would turn out. louie might not share my enthusiasm for this creative costume. but he’d forget all about it when he set eyes on my granddaughters  evi and mea. he’d jump out of the car and happily trot with them along the street  greeting other children  trying to get a peek into their candy loot. i just knew louie would have more fun than he could imagine if he could just push through wearing a silly cow outfit and look as much like a dalmatian as he could..i also imagined it would make a great blog lesson: all about pressing through uncomfortable situations to enjoy the outcome. sounds good  right?.being someone we’re not.but none of that happened. yes  lou was happy to see evi and mea. he did enjoy it when other children came up to love on him. but he hated his costume and was mad at me the entire time. he wouldn’t even pose for a picture  and believe me  that’s not like him..i finally took the costume off and let him be louie..too often we find ourselves being something we don’t want to be. maybe it’s of our own doing — because we think we need to fit in  and it requires being someone “different.” but often it’s because someone else expects us to be different than what we are..maybe it’s a negative thing: a boss requires us to be something based on their own insecurities. or maybe it’s positive: a leader sees potential in us that we don’t see or can even imagine  and they want to coach us to be better..no matter the reason  we resist because it is uncomfortable to be something we are not. we don’t want to don a costume and fake it..can’t make anyone change.it’s tough to balance being authentic and at the same time develop beyond mediocrity toward excellence. it can feel like donning a facade and “faking it till we make it.” what should leaders do to help folks grow?.if you’re in a position of leadership  you can suggest someone continue to develop. you can provide tools  mentoring  and ongoing training. but you can’t make them be something they don’t want to be. each person is responsible for taking that first step to wanting to make significant changes in their lives..still  there are ways to influence those in whom you see potential. for example:.watch to see whether the person shows an eagerness to learn and grow  i.e.  reading books and asking for help..ask them where do they see themselves going? what is their end goal?.share with them what potential you see in them..be sure your expectations align with their skillset and desires..if their end goal and desires outweigh their skillset  place them on a realistic development plan and be clear about expectations..greater than they imagine.when louie and i arrived back home  he was one tired pup. he slinked upstairs to his little bed to lay down. his expression told me he was still traumatized by the costume. but as i knelt down to give him a kiss  i looked into his eyes and saw a little spark..it was a look that said  “if you are trying to make me be something different than who i am  at least make me a lion!”.and with that  he tucked his head into the fold of his front paw and fell fast asleep. no doubt  that evening he dreamt of being a lion..louie the lion…hear me

oldest granddaughter  evi  share our dog louie’s story with her younger sister  mea. though you may have heard this “tail” a time or two before  i thought you would enjoy this rendition:.“a long time ago  there was a little dog who was all alone in the woods. he was scared and afraid and felt very  very alone. it was nighttime and then daylight and then nighttime  again and again. once  he saw another little animal and thought  ‘oh  that looks like someone who could be my friend.’ but the animal was a mean cat. it hissed and clawed at the poor little dog  scratching his ear till it started to bleed. ‘my ’ said the pup. ‘i guess it doesn’t want to be my friend.’ the little dog still has a mark on his ear..“the poor little dog was sad  but he kept on going because he knew somewhere  someone would love him. he was so tired that he couldn’t keep his head up. he came to a road and a woman who was driving by saw him and picked him up. she took him to a place filled with lots of people and other dogs. the people called and called and called all sorts of places to find out if anyone owned the dog. they put up signs and waited and waited  but no one came to see the little dog. he still felt all alone..“one morning  the people put the little dog in a van and drove him far  far away. they took him to an adopt-a-pet store. there  he saw a nice lady who took him home. he was scared at first  but then the lady opened the door to her home  and two little girls were waiting for him. they hugged him and kissed his head and called him their brother. louie finally found a place he called home and two sisters who loved him very much.”.mea’s mouth dropped open as she squealed  “lou-weeeeee?”.“yep  that’s louie’s story ” evi proudly announced..i smiled as i heard the tale so poignantly shared. once again  louie’s story tugged at my heart as i thought about our little dog wandering the streets and wooded areas  not knowing where he was or where he should go. it is even sadder to think that despite the shelter’s efforts to find his family  no one came to take him home. louie was unclaimed and unloved—a very sad state  indeed..since he first came to live in my home  there has been no question that he is loved. i’ve gladly claimed him as my little pal  and he truly is a brother to evi and mea. he knows where home is. every time we take a walk  he’ll look up at me with those big  brown eyes  and i’ll ask  “do you want to go home  lou?” with a spring in his step and dogged determination  he’ll prance all the way home with little guidance from me. i have been unwavering in working through life’s tough spots to build a relationship of trust  and it has paid off in huge dividends of joy for louie and me as well as for evi  mea  and many other people whom louie has come to know and love..being unclaimed and unloved is not limited to adopted pups. many people in our lives have suffered through this emotional pain. many times  these people are close friends  teammates  bosses  or fellow board members. we never know who they are because  in today’s shallow society  we don’t take the time to learn about people’s lives. we often wonder what is wrong with individuals who act out  but in many cases  these people may be unclaimed and unloved and are looking for others they can trust. don’t be like the cat in louie’s tale and lash out at them..before passing judgment on others  take the time to learn their stories. people are fascinating  and everyone has a unique history. once you learn about someone and take the time to get to know them  you’ll see them blossom and grow. learning about others is imperative to help our team build trust and learn to walk in their strengths. be the leader who is unwavering in working through tough spots to build a relationship of trust. this effort will pay off in huge dividends of joy and—believe it or not—productivity..if you are reading this blog  i want you to know you are not unclaimed or unloved  no matter what has happened to you in your past. god is unwavering in his love for us. it is up to us to joyfully accept and receive such love..as for louie—he has taught me so much about love and determination. i am never without a lesson from this little chap. he has also opened my eyes to that fact that my sweet evi is carrying on the nonna tradition of being the “best story maker” ever.

model.september 17  2016 september 16  2016 by danisedistasi.we hope you enjoyed your summer. in celebration of the 3rd anniversary of louie’s adoption  we decided to to do an extended blog  introducing our louie leadership model..our story began three years ago in the rolling hills of boyd county  kentucky—a place i never knew existed. it’s your typical love story: boy meets girl  boy woos girl with his charming ways and big brown eyes  girl is swept off her feet  and they fall in love and live happily ever after. except in this story  the boy is an adopted puppy named louie..although i have a tremendous amount of leadership experience  i never truly understood leadership until i met this little guy..our blog  and my soon-to-be-released third book  louie’s leadership lessons  are compilations of time-tested leadership models  heart-warming stories of courage and love  and techniques for overcoming common issues such as pride  fear  and doubt—all illustrated by eye-opening experiences with my rescue dog. the time i spent with him and his trainer was life changing..this extended blog is the introduction to our new book and contains nuggets of wisdom i’ve learned over the decades about leadership and the gift of relationships with a fresh perspective renewed by louie’s point of view..i have distilled all louie has taught me into a leadership model that is easy to remember and easy to follow. when you have a leadership dilemma  ask yourself  “what would louie do?” the answer is in his name: louie..love.louie was either lost or abandoned in kentucky and made his way to cincinnati  where i live  through a number of shelters. although i love dogs  i had decided not to get another one for many reasons—that is  until i just happened to stop by petsmart while they were conducting an adopt-a-pet weekend and encountered this abandoned mutt with big brown. i tossed my concerns aside  brought him home  and named him louie distasi. i soon discovered that louie had brought a lot of emotional baggage to the relationship. he demonstrated behaviors that deeply concerned me  and i engaged a dog trainer to help address them. i quickly realized i needed training as much as louie did  if not more so..i’m not afraid of tough lessons  and i’m always looking for ways to improve my leadership skills. but working with louie was challenging. the bottom line was that louie needed acceptance  consistency  discipline  and—above all—unconditional love. i wasn’t sure i was equipped to provide all that..when i first met louie  he was very sweet and subdued in his crate. several hours after we arrived home  he became much more active. i loved louie when he was a good little dog  but i didn’t love him so much when he started to act out and behaved badly when people came to the door  etc. it was a struggle  and i had to make a choice to love him. i decided to commit to loving this abandoned pup  in spite of his baggage..employees can be like louie. they bring a lot of baggage to the job and may be hard to love at times. one of the most critical needs for any human being is the need to feel loved. all of us have this innate desire  yet it is one of the most difficult to fulfill. c. s. lewis said it best:.“to be loved but not known is comforting but superficial. to be known and not loved is our greatest fear. but to be fully known and truly loved is  well  a lot like being loved by god. it is what we need more than anything. it liberates us from pretense  humbles us out of our self-righteousness  and fortifies us for any difficulty life can throw at us.”.love is not merely a warm fuzzy feeling; love in action is the aspect that is important in leadership. when i mention the word “love” in the workplace  i receive a tremendous amount of pushback. people say  “don’t bring it up; you’ll have hr issues.” i question whether people understand what love really means..while employees can be hard to love at times (maybe most of the time)  it is still your choice to love or be indifferent toward them. let’s look at the characteristics of leaders who love:.they are patient..they are kind..they honor other people..they are honest..they are protective..they are trustworthy..they are always hopeful..they persevere through difficult situations..they are other seeking and other serving..they manage their emotions well..of course  there are also things that they are not:.they aren’t envious..they aren’t boastful..they aren’t prideful..they don’t keep records of wrongs..the characteristics of loving leaders are those that leaders should display when they are working with their people—baggage and all. that’s what love in action looks like..servant leaders are those who display the characteristics above. they are humble enough to serve and strong enough to lead..objectives and goals.the next thing i learned in the course of training louie was that  as a leader  i needed clear objectives and plans for how to achieve them. this is true with our teams at work  as well. objectives must be clear and specific. they have to be trackable. they have to be relevant. they have to be attainable and motivating..i engaged a trainer who taught me that my first goal in this journey with louie was to establish my role as leader. yep—i actually had to learn how to be louie’s alpha. i wrongly assumed he would know i was in charge because i’m bigger than him  i own the house  i pay for the meals. assuming is a mistake many leaders make. throughout our blog  you’ll read the importance of objectives and goals with each lesson i learned through louie..understanding.another lesson i learned was to truly understand that louie had “stuff” in his background. fear and anxiety issues were at the top of the list. these may have come from abandonment or abuse—it’s hard to say. but it is not unlike everyone we meet  whether he or she is on our team  or just a person whose path we crossed in the grocery store. every human being needs to feel loved and valued. it is our innermost need  and it was this little dog’s need as well. he had never had a sense of being valued in his life  and he needed to know that someone cared about him. i had to understand louie’s struggles to love him  which would enable me to set clear objectives and goals for our journey together. i needed to understand louie’s issues. it wasn’t easy to get past some of them. they were real and profound..as leaders  we need to take the time to understand our people. we need to realize that there’s always something about a person’s circumstances that we don’t know  and before we judge people  we need to try to understand them..when you run into an issue with someone and your first inclination is to become upset  try the paws method to help you analyze the situation before doing something you may regret:.pause…breathe! allow oxygen to get to your brain..ask the person questions: “what’s going on?” “can you tell me more?” “help me understand.” “is everything ok?” ask yourself questions: “why does this aggravate me?”.use wisdom. choose your words wisely. i would much rather have people feel uncomfortable waiting for me to find the right words than i ever would with words that could be hurtful..seek to understand. once you pause  ask questions  and choose your words wisely  you will naturally seek to understand. remember  everyone has “stuff” in his or her backgrounds. and so do you!.as leaders  we need to make an effort to understand. take time to understand your people and avoid making assumptions. throughout this blog  there are many lessons relating to how i learned to understand louie  who could not verbally communicate with me. these lessons will help you understand how others communicate and process ideas differently than you do—and that’s ok..investment.i then learned to invest my time and talent into developing louie. we should ask ourselves  “how much time do we invest in our teams? our families? our friends?” take the time to get to know people and invest in them..this picture breaks my heart. this is louie the first night he came home with me. he curled up in the corner  scared and alone. i put a pillow next to him to provide some comfort. louie now sleeps in a very open bed in my bedroom because he feels safe with me  and i with him. i chose to invest a tremendous amount of time in louie so that he could learn to trust and love me. it took time. everything takes time. you cannot go wrong by investing your time getting to know people. take them out to lunch. ask them questions. this point relates back to understanding. it links to feeling valued  and it relates to feeling loved. take time to gather information. you never know what you can uncover when you give your time..there are many suggestions for  and examples of  investing in others throughout our blog. get to know people  spend time with them  share your talents and your skill set; put effort into your relationships with people because you want to give without receiving anything in return. i can guarantee that if you are a leader  and you do this  your team will be more productive  creative  and effective. it is the foundation for a healthy culture. invest your time..empowerment.the last step in my leadership training with louie was to empower him. empowering your team is essential  but it’s not simply letting people do whatever they want to do. empowering is taking the time to love them and establishing clear objectives and goals. it is understanding them  and investing in them. once you do these things  your people will be empowered to use their gifts and talents to do their jobs; and in doing so  you empower them to be the people god created them to be—not who you think they should be. they will be loved and valued..louie is an entirely different dog today because i love him. i took the time to set up a development plan and was clear about objectives and goals for him to be a good  healthy dog and for us to enjoy a relationship together. i had to understand his needs. i had to understand his background. i had to figure out what was going on with him. i invested time  my skill set  and other people’s skill sets to help develop him. he is empowered to be a fun-loving  free little dog..my work with louie is not unlike leading our teams. transformation occurs when we apply the louie leadership model: love  objectives  understanding  investment  and empowerment  as well as the paws model: pause  ask  wisdom  and seek. throughout louie’s leadership lessons  you will see more examples of these two models wrapped in stories of love  struggles  and immense joy..while it brings me great pleasure to know that louie is a transformed dog  i am the one who has been profoundly changed into a better leader because of the lessons i’ve learned from my experiences with him. we look forward to continuing our journey with you through our

can hear him all the way down the street. people will turn and wait as louie’s whines get louder and his tail wags faster. he’ll run towards the person or one of his furry friends. he excitedly greets them and then boom! he’s on to the next friend..people know he’s going to do that to them. they watch him run and hear his excitement and after a few doggie sniffs he quickly moves on. my neighbors fully expect him to behave this way because they’ve witnessed this so many times. and now it’s the talk of the neighborhood…how snooty little louie distasi can be..i make excuses and justify his behavior by saying things like  “he’s very focused on his walk ” or “don’t take it personal  he’s anxious to keep moving.” it is obvious his reputation clearly precedes him as we walk through the neighborhood..this behavior has me ponder the importance of our reputations. it is much harder to build a reputation than to destroy it. building a good reputation requires patience  solid values  intentionality and time. destroying a good reputation only requires a single moment’s mistake. to build a good reputation  be a person who is worthy of one. demonstrate the characteristics you want others to associate with you..i had the honor and pleasure to work with ken blanchard in early 2000. during a lead like jesus workshop in 2001  he shared a memorable exercise that left an indelible imprint on my mind and heart..ken told a story about swedish chemist alfred bernhard nobel  who invented dynamite in 1866 and became rich. nobel was as interested in drama and poetry as he was in chemistry and physics  but it was in the sciences that he made his fame  and by the time of his death he held more than 350 patents and controlled factories and labs in 20 countries..when alfred nobel’s brother died a newspaper mistakenly published an obituary of alfred that emphasized the fact that he had invented things that blew up and killed people. nobel  not wanting to be remembered in that way  pledged his wealth toward the betterment of humanity. in his will he directed the establishment of a foundation to award annual prizes for achievement in chemistry  physics  literature  and efforts toward international peace  which is known as the nobel prize. this award is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the world and includes a cash prize of nearly one million dollars..ken asked  “what do you want your obituary to say about you?” he had the participants write out their thoughts. and then he asked  “what do you have to do today to be the person you want to be remembered as?”.that exercise had a profound effect on me then and still does today. i don’t want to be gone and people have to drum up something about me being a compassionate and deeply caring person. i commit to living out those characteristics today..i encourage you to do the exercise ken has had so many people around the world engage in doing: write your own obituary. take time to figure out how you want to be remembered and then commit to being that person today!.as for louie  it may be too late. it seems his reputation precedes him and not in a good way. we’ll have to continue to work on his relational skills and how he engages with others. stay tuned!.**louie and i hope you and your family will join us in remembering the countless men and women who have fought for our country. give thanks for those who have given their lives and always thank a veteran and those currently serving!**.click the image for information on how to order louie’s leadership lessons.email

according to merriam-webster’s definition  it is an awareness of one’s own personality or individuality. to this definition  i would add “flaws and all!” few leaders practice self-awareness because there is a mindset that says  “don’t be too introspective; keep moving ahead; don’t be too concerned about what other’s think of you.”.there is some validity in that advice  but as in everything  we need to balance that information. here are a few characteristics of relational leaders who are self-aware:.they know themselves well..they are always seeking and welcome feedback. they are not quick to make excuses or justifications when honest feedback is given..they are aware of the traits that hold them back  and take action to address them..they are conscious of their weaknesses and look to hire people who perform well in the areas where they lack expertise..they are natural delegators..they read people well (louie does this also. maybe he is more self-aware than i give him credit for)..self-awareness is key to our emotional health and the relational health of our team. it is actually freeing when you recognize the areas that are holding you back and release them so that others can step up to the plate and excel in their strengths..ask others to assist you in becoming more self-aware. the growth potential for not only you as a leader but for your team as well is astonishing and rewarding by way of a healthy culture and employee engagement..for now  i am still impressed with louie’s awareness of his environment. his self-awareness probably extends to his level of insecurities and fears only…but it’s a start!.monday  march 20  2017  is louie’s 5th birthday. my granddaughters decided his birthday should always be on the first day of spring because he is so full of life! send him an email to wish him a happy birthday louie@di-advisors.com..please click here to sign up for louie’s leadership lessons blog..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  fundamentals in leadership  healthy culture  honesty  leadership  the louie model  the paws model  transparency  trust  uncategorized tags #creatingrelationships  #developinggoals  #empoweringyourteam  #resolvingconflictpaws  #selfawareness  #simpleleadershipmodel leave a comment.will you please stop whining.february 6  2017 february 7  2017 by danisedistasi.a passing thought drifted through my mind the other day: i will miss all the love and attention i have received over the past few weeks. but since i would rather hear “wow  you’re doing so well” than “oh  gee  sorry you’re still struggling with your recovery ” the thought passed quickly  never to return..because i’m ready to close the chapter on my accident and subsequent surgery  my passing thought is not what the subject line is referring to. this is a blog about my persnickety pup louie and his ever-increasing need to whine. while i know he suffered trauma over the past couple of months along with me  his whining seems to have increased exponentially rather than to have subsided as i would have expected. i soon discovered his behavior has nothing to do with my injury. instead  louie is reacting to a new dog in the neighborhood..this new dog represents everything louie hates. the dog is a male  he’s bigger than lou  and he’s . . . shhhh . . . not neutered. the last issue sends louie into a tizzy even before we walk out the door. his hackles go up  and he puffs out his chest and huffs as he walks out. but then the incessant whining begins. and once he starts that  it’s tough to get him to stop..one morning as we exited the garage  we made a sharp left turn out of our driveway and hurried away from where the dog lives as quickly as a girl with a cane can manage. louie looked back  whined  and seemed disoriented. i tugged on his collar and gave a stern command  “leave it ” which he immediately obeyed  but his memory is keen  and it quickly took him back to the dark side. i was hoping he would find a new smell to distract him..thanks to zig our dog trainer  i learned a long time ago that louie whines out of fear  so i have to step up and walk with confidence. that’s tough to do considering i’m still healing  but i did the best i could. louie suspiciously eyed the cane  and then looked back at me with a face that said he was not convinced i could protect us both . . . and i didn’t blame him..as our walk settled into a more relaxed pace  i reflected on why some people  like louie  seem to whine so much. do you have a few whiners on your team? it’s easy to get frustrated and dismiss them  but there is usually something deeper going on that we may never uncover unless we take the time to do so..fear is a big issue for louie  which is why he whines. fear is a big issue for people as well and could be the reason some folks whine. i have learned to counter louie’s fear  not with my confidence but with love. love is the first step of the louie leadership model:.love is foundational to building trust and integrity for a personal or professional relationship to flourish. without love and trust  our relationships are like fragile shells that have nothing inside of them and with the slightest amount of pressure  are easily shattered. because of the love i have demonstrated for louie on a regular basis  he has learned to trust me. [for more on leading with trust  see this article by my friend  randy conley  vice president of client services & trust practice leader for the ken blanchard companies.].a teammate may whine because the team is experiencing a daunting and uncomfortable change. loving people through such change does not mean we coddle them. it means we shed light on the situation  we share the truth  and we press through together..love is more impactful than complaining to others that someone is a whiner..our society tends to misuse the word love. in fact  very few understand the strength and character it takes to love others. we have fluffy commercials about it  emoticons  and facebook posts. martin luther king  jr. said  “darkness cannot drive out darkness  only light can do that. hate cannot drive out hate  only love can do that.”.and who can argue with this verse: “such love has no fear because perfect love expels all fear. if we are afraid  it is for fear of punishment  and this shows that we have not fully experienced his (god’s) perfect love.”.i doubt louie will be able to love the new dog in the neighborhood anytime soon. in fact  i’m sure he is hoping the dog moves away. in the meantime  i’m working on loving lou through this ordeal and rebuilding his confidence and trust in me so he knows i will never allow another dog to threaten him..but louie is a dog and as humans  we can choose to love. you can be the change agent for someone by removing fear of punishment or detrimental consequences and instilling love instead. such love is the gateway to experiencing god’s perfect love and the cornerstone on which excellent and effective leadership is built..note: my friend t.d. hughes knows how emphatic i am about leadership and love and recently sent me an article i thought you would enjoy as well. it’s okay to love your employees.**speaking of love  louie sends his love for a wonderful valentine’s day**.picture compliments of louie’s favorite place  best

that means!.january 24  2017 january 24  2017 by danisedistasi.our last blog detailed a journey i’m glad to say i am more than halfway through. if all goes well  my release date from all restrictions is february 1  2017. i am off all pain medication  and i took my first solo drive yesterday. i am beginning to see some normalcy slowly trickle back into my life. again  i am completely humbled by the continued outpouring of love and encouragement. thank you!.and then  there’s louie! louie was as traumatized as i was through this journey. he had to adjust to my being gone for two weeks; friends coming and going  walking and feeding him  playing with him  all while he constantly watched the door with the hope i would walk through it any minute..now that i’m home and he’s learned to trust my erratic movements with a cane  he seems to have settled back into some interesting habits: growling at people who come to my door (even his dog walkers) and jumping on the couch to sit directly across from me (better to watch me  he says)..one evening  a friend came by to take louie for a walk. after they finished and she came in to sit with me for awhile  he ran into the house  checked on me  and then ran upstairs  where he ran the length of the hallway several times. then  i heard a big commotion  and from where i was sitting  i could tell what that little rascal was doing. he was getting into my clothesbasket in my bathroom and taking all the clothes out of it  having no consideration whatsoever for the amount of time it took me to get the clothes into that basket..his continued motion  which was evident even though he was a floor above me  indicated he not only removed the items from the basket  he was also rolling in them—all of them! some time ago  i explained to zig  our trainer  louie’s annoying bad habit of rolling in the dirty laundry. i assumed it was because he wanted to surround himself with my smell  weird as that is..but zig assured me that was not it at all. louie was getting his smell on my clothes  showing his dominance over me. what? now that is a really annoying bad habit that makes me realize we are back to square one. there will be no dominance of louie over me..but this is not surprising. when it takes all my energy to walk from the living room to the kitchen  disciplining a dog is not high on my list  especially since we’ve been through this before. the pressure was off of louie to behave well  and when the pressure is off  he reverts back to his old habits..that is so like us. a while ago  i wrote a blog about something i learned from my time with the ken blanchard companies about the dynamics of change. one dynamic is that when the pressure is off  we revert to our original behaviors. well  the pressure was definitely off  and louie was back to some of his old habits. we will need to spend time correcting that. but rather than lament  i reflected on what this means as far as my recent journey and getting “back to normal.”.finally being able to drive did give me a sense of life getting back to normal. getting off medication  walking better  and looking forward to some normalcy were great goals for recovery. but did i really want normalcy to be my goal?.not this time  not this year. i am going to be intentional (keeping the pressure on) about breaking past the norm to live a well-meaning life by doing the following:.pruning activities  objects  and even some relationships  all to devote precious time to what matters;.being kind in thought  word  and deed  whether people deserve it or not. i don’t mean just merely being nice (and sometimes superficial and phony)  but being authentic and loving—speaking truth in love and showing those who differ from me  or have differing viewpoints  the compassion that only comes from faith in god;.taking time to listen in order to learn—and not rushing to the next project;.being still and having plenty of margin in my life;.laughing more; and.dancing (okay  that one is normal for me  but now takes on an even more special meaning). i will take time to dance more with my grandchildren and even my adult daughter because that’s what distasi kids do. my niece sara is getting married in september  and she has promised we will dance the night away. that is my goal for 2017..be intentional about breaking past the norm. life is too short and too easily interrupted for us to stay stuck in the status quo. and you are never too old to take that first step to crashing through the “same ol’  same ol’.”.as for louie  we have some work to do. as i have been writing  he slipped into my laundry room and pulled out a dishtowel. he is so bad. i know he has a large fan base of people who love him  but this annoying little habit just makes me shake my head. i suppose being intentionally kind starts now with little louie distasi!.click the cover to order louie’s leadership legacy book..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble

danisedistasi.today was the first day i was able to wrap my arms around louie and give him a huge bear hug. it was three weeks ago that i had an accident and our lives quickly changed. and in celebrating my ability to hug him and receive an under the neck snuggle from him  i thought it fitting to resume our blog after an unintentionally extended vacation..december 18  2016  was filled with great anticipation. it was one week before christmas  and the distasi family was planning to gather at my house to celebrate christmas. everything was set; the massive amounts of food  the decorations  gifts  and music. it was to be a celebration to top all the ones we had celebrated so far as a family..louie and i took our usual stroll early that morning. two days before  there had been a late evening ice storm  but this particular morning seemed okay as far as icy pavement was concerned. still  i was cautious and walked in the grass as much as possible..an elderly neighbor has a very long driveway  and louie and i had been taking her daily newspaper to her so she would not have to venture out and lean over to pick it up. as soon as i stepped on the driveway  my feet flew up in the air  and i landed on my left hip. i lost control of louie  and it took me a few moments to catch my breath. i couldn’t see louie  and panic was about to set in. his normal reaction when something startles him is to run away. and seeing his mama flying through the air had to have been startling..i forced myself to turn as far to the left as i could. there louie sat  close behind my left shoulder. i reached around to draw him close to me. as he tucked his head under my arm  i felt his shaking and heard him whimper. to hear him cry broke my heart  and my tears started to flow uncontrollably. i knew i could not move—and whatever would take place from that moment forward  it would be a long journey. louie chose to stay by me as the faithful friend that he is..a neighbor pulled up with his phone in hand  already calling 911  and i called my friend and neighbor cindy to pick up louie. i called my daughter  marisa  and the network of community  family  and friends jumped into action. everyone’s life was interrupted on december 18  2016..after a jarring ambulance ride  surgery to repair a femur that was fractured in two places  a total hip replacement  five days in the hospital  and physical therapy  i was released to marisa and matt’s home for respite care and to celebrate christmas with the two cutest nurses on the face of the earth. louie had been well taken care of by my wonderful neighbors who had walked him  let him stay in their homes  taken him to daycare to play  and given him more love than he could imagine..life interrupted has taught louie and me a few things:.we appreciate life and the little things: although that seems so cliché  it was the small steps of accomplishment that filled me with joy. every day  i set new goals to accomplish—goals i never would have dreamed to set before. for instance  i learned to get out of bed  to go to the bathroom  and to take my meds without having to wake my daughter to help me. and to carry a cup of coffee in the morning to enjoy my quiet time. mea and evi helped me do things as they watched me improve. christmas had a deeper meaning this year with sincere thankfulness  love  and joy!.you really do know who your friends are: so many people dropped everything to help. it was a terrible strain on marisa and matt as they took care of me. so many friends offered to grocery shop  run errands  and stay with me when i finally came home. my sisters and cousin packed their clothes and took turns staying overnight. my brothers were calling  visiting  and bringing food. the neighbors who took care of louie were such godsends. many people could not help because of logistics  but they checked in and prayed..you have to move out of your comfort zone: this was a tough one for louie and me. i had to let people help me. what a humbling position to be in; i was helpless. i have never stayed in a hospital other than to give birth. i don’t take any medicines  and i have never fractured a single bone. the outpouring of love and encouragement has been overwhelming. louie had to be comfortable with people coming and going in and out of our home and driving him to and from daycare. but we both pressed on through pain  frustration  fear  and being uncomfortable. it was difficult  but i believe we made it past the hardest part of this process. there’s still much more healing to take place and there will always be a next move out of our comfort zone. i have no doubt we’ll press through that too..some things just do not matter: the superficiality of the holidays clashed with the richness of genuine  loving relationships. there can be no comparison of the things that are bought with the things that are sought  caught  and taught. the characteristics of love  joy  and peace are important for us to live and pass on to others. it takes effort  but it is worth the time and effort. i am a better person because of the love  joy  and peace that others shared with me this season..2017 is going to be a great year of love and strength. louie is a better dog because he chose faithfulness over running away. he trusted and allowed others into his world to help us! we are closer because of these last few weeks. thank you to so many for being in my life and for your prayers and support!.click here to sign up for louie’s email list..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and

2017 june 7  2016 by danisedistasi.i was sitting outside working on my computer; writing  emailing  information gathering  compiling reports—all the necessary tasks for an entrepreneur. it was a beautiful morning  and i was feeling quite proud of my productivity. during my flurry of activity  i noticed one constant being that didn’t flinch the entire time i was working—louie!.it wasn’t that he was asleep and not moving  he was laying down and fully awake. sometimes he gazes into the trees looking for some creature that dares to walk across his kingdom…but not this time. he was just being! he was serenely experiencing every bit of beauty that nature offered. i have no doubt that he thought it was all for his pleasure alone..as i watched him  i couldn’t help but think  “it must be nice to be my dog and relax on the deck while i work to provide a nice home and good food.” then i had to laugh. louie was teaching me a lesson that took me years to grasp and yet is still so easy to forget—how to just be. we get caught up in the mode of i’ve got to do more  work more  network more  socialize more  facebook more  more  more  more. help—let me off this merry-go-round!.i’m not sure what louie was thinking as he quietly enjoyed nature  but he inspired me to close my computer and experience the stillness as well. ahhh  there it was  something i had been missing—peacefulness. most of us never take the time to practice being still and emptying our minds of the stuff that clutters our thinking and clouds our wellbeing. the ability to just be is crucial to our ability to lead well..there is an assumption that sitting quietly means you’re not doing anything. but that may be our most productive time of creativity or processing a difficult issue…or praying about how to respond to something..recently  my peacefulness was disturbed by an offense against someone who is close to me. while my initial reaction was to clear up the wrong and let everyone know the information being spread was a lie…i decided to do what louie does and just be. i took a few moments to process  and i did not jump on social media to see what all the craziness was about. i actually practiced being still and not reacting out of indignant anger. instead  i focused my energy on encouraging the person who was wronged. i know that  given time  the truth always prevails..i know another leader who demonstrated the leadership quality of “being.” ken blanchard and phil hodges  who wrote lead like jesus  shared the five habits of jesus. the first one is solitude; “jesus modeled solitude as an integral  strategic component of his leadership. in solitude and prayer  away from the hopes and hurts of those who looked to him with high and compelling expectations  jesus again received instructions on the best use of the next day from the father.” this also gave jesus the strength to stand up to others who gossiped  mocked and eventually crucified him. he didn’t draw a sword nor did he spew angry words  yet his quiet spirit shook people to the very core of their being. now that’s power!.just being is necessary for us to make good decisions that positively affect our lives and those around us. be intentional about being still..to celebrate louie’s sweet ability to be still  we are taking the summer off from blogging to fine-tune his l.o.u.i.e./p.a.w.s. leadership model  spend time with my two adorable grandchildren  finish two writing projects  and focus more on my clients with whom i truly enjoy..louie is scheduling appearances over the summer to visit various workplaces and to accompany me during my speeches. if you have a desire to meet louie  please contact his agent at char@di-advisors.com..we’ll return to our regularly scheduled blog in the fall  and we hope you enjoy some peace and quiet..categories uncategorized 5 comments.what a big mouth you have  louie!.october 22  2016 may 11  2016 by danisedistasi.we were enjoying an early morning walk when we came upon two dogs we’ve never met before. one of them is a twin of louie. she is a corgi-beagle mix  and she even has the same facial markings as louie. she is a bit smaller than louie  and her name is peanut..there was a noticeable difference  however  in the size of their mouths. like her name  she was a peanut  and her mouth was tiny compared to louie’s very big mouth. louie’s mouth can do many things: bark  growl  show his teeth  eat  and mouth to pull and play. louie provides “love taps” by poking his mouth against your hand when he is excited to see you. his mouth is conveniently attached to his nose which he uses to poke and prod. they work together to borough in the ground and pull lumps of grass to get to a mole..although louie’s large mouth is actually harmless  he could do a lot of damage with it. this is not unlike ourselves. our mouths  specifically our tongues  may seem harmless  but oh the damage they can do and usually  unnecessarily..i love what the bible teaches us about the tongue. “a bit in the mouth of a horse controls the whole horse. a small rudder on a huge ship in the hands of a skilled captain sets a course in the face of the strongest winds. a word out of your mouth may seem of no account  but it can accomplish nearly anything—or destroy it! it only takes a spark  remember  to set off a forest fire. a careless or wrongly placed word out of your mouth can do that. by our speech we can ruin the world  turn harmony to chaos  throw mud on a reputation  send the whole world up in smoke and go up in smoke with it…” and “you can tame a tiger  but you can’t tame a tongue—it’s never been done.”.we have the power to use our words to give life or to bring death to our relationships. hurtful words can be used in slander  gossip  arguing  criticizing  complaining  distasteful language  boasting  and lying. and the damage can be irreparable. as we read that list  we shake our heads for we clearly know others who do these things. yet  there’s a small voice within us that whispers  “could this be me?”.i believe we are all guilty of some or all of these things. for the sake of brevity  let’s focus on the first two: gossip and slander. by definition  gossip is sharing personal or sensational facts about others; sharing private information with those who are not part of the problem or solution. slander is using words  tonal patterns or facial expressions to deliberately damage someone else’s reputation with information that does not need to be shared..we all do this either subtly or with as much gusto as possible  and perhaps we are not aware of the damage we are doing. i am most grieved by those who teach and preach against gossip and yet do so under the guise of caring for the person they are talking about  or worse  having the need to play the victim role and share how unfair someone treated them..it takes intentionality to not step foot on the slippery slope of gossip and slander. it is not easy  but i am committing to these steps  thanks to louie’s inspiration:.paws.pause: there is power in the pause. when we pause before speaking  we gain time to process our thoughts. i’d rather make people uncomfortable with my pause than with my words. i’ve never regretted my pauses  but too many times  i have regretted my words..ask: ask yourself these things: what’s going on with me? why do i have this need to share this? would i want this person sharing information about me? would i share this if the other person were in front of me? reflect on your answers before you speak..wisdom: choose your words wisely. when we speak from a place of wisdom  people are more inclined to listen. carefully consider the words you are about to say. if they are not life-giving  do not say them. nothing good comes from useless  mindless words..stop and seek to understand: stop gossiping for one day. when we want to lose weight  we log our food to keep track of what we are putting into our bodies. take a day this week to log how many times you talk about someone else. that may make you more aware of how easily gossip has seeped into your life. then ask a friend to hold you accountable when you are together  and commit to not talking about others. seek to understand the other person before casting judgement..through my relationship with louie  i have learned a tremendous amount about my relationships with humans. with the size of his mouth  he could take a chunk out of someone  but he clearly chooses not to (up to this point). in that same way  i want nothing to stand in my way with those who are in my life  even those with whom i interact for a short time. i am going to stamp out gossip and slander in my life using the paws method. i hope you will join me..categories

girls  and there are several in this neighborhood. kaki and ali were two of his favorites. there’s eve  who has no problem with letting louie know she has had enough of playtime. ellie throws her paws around him and loves to run and play. and then there’s snickers  who used to turn her nose up at lou  now walks side by side with him..i am the alpha of the alpha girls in louie’s world  and although there are times when lou tries to exercise his independence  he is absolutely in love with me—and i with him..my question is twofold. what is it about alpha girls that makes them so alpha? and what is it about them that has louie so enthralled?.first  i’m not sure many women would deem themselves alpha girls. yet many are  and although this is usually a good thing  it can sometimes be devastating. over the span of my career  i have been blessed to know many strong women and have noticed an interesting phenomenon: few strong women  myself included  have truly achieved balance. i’m not talking about work–life balance  or “integration”; it goes beyond that. there always seems to be something off-kilter that we as women want to straighten out or bring into balance  yet it eludes us..but on this journey  if we remain diligent  there is a sweet spot that allows us to walk in harmonious balance: strength without being pushy  boldness without overpowering others  and humility without appearing weak. every woman’s quest for that sweet spot leads her on a journey of struggle and change  which can be difficult and yet incredibly freeing and rewarding..so many times we stop just short of finding this sweet spot. a driving force takes over  and we feel that if we don’t propel ourselves to the top  running over others along the way  then we simply will not survive. that’s the lie many women today have bought into. i believe the antidote to being pushy  rude  and weak is simply love  joy  and peace..it takes strength to love others. love is the ultimate test of strength. this is the deepest desire of every being  human and pets. when you truly love other people  you care more about them than you do about yourself. it is nearly impossible to be pushy with them. instead  you care more about serving.when we think of boldness  we think of someone blasting on the scene  taking a stand  and being brave. tip that boldness over the edge a bit  and you end up running over others and being rude. joy is our elated response to experiences of life  even when life is tough. it is our response and deep satisfaction when we are able to serve others  not as an obligation but because our heart prompts us to do so. when we have true joy in our heart  rudeness cannot emerge..humility is the toughest characteristic to maintain  but once it is  inner peace is achieved. and when you’re at peace  it doesn’t matter if someone thinks you are weak..i would like to see more women strive to balance strength  boldness  and humility by honing the character strengths of love  joy  and peace. we can do it!.as for why louie loves alpha girls—they challenge him to be strong  brave (or bold)  and fun (which equates to inner peace in louie’s world). one of his favorite alphas was his gal pal ali. when she was outside  he could see her all the way down the street and would whine and pull to get a chance to dance around the front yard with her. she loved to play rough with louie. he learned a little trick; he could stand just far enough away that her leash wouldn’t allow her to reach him. his ears would go back  and he was on alert. she would stretch to get closer to him. then  he would ease closer  and the dance would begin. he’d back up and then move closer—they truly enjoyed playing together. ali challenged him to be a better  stronger  and more playful dog  and we are forever thankful..strive to walk in the balance of strength  boldness  and humility. choose love  joy  and peace. in this sweet spot  you will impact others’ lives for the better  thereby truly making a difference in our world..to my alpha girl friends: louie and i are celebrating the release of my new book  hide and seek; discovering your hidden treasures. women were created to walk in the harmonious balance of being strong  not pushy; bold  not rude; and humble  not weak. every women’s quest for that sweet spot leads them on a journey of struggle and change  which may be difficult  yet so incredibly freeing and rewarding. hide and seek tells the story of a female business owner named belle who struggles to move past underlying fear and doubt. readers  especially women in business  will resonate with belle’s struggles…they will be able to identify in their own life the vicious cycle of feeling insecure  building a façade so that others see what they want them to see and how this leads to our lives being out of balance. all will welcome learning how certain characteristics lead to a more balanced life..read our latest news….categories uncategorized leave a comment.life long friends.february 23  2016 february 24  2016 by danisedistasi.i’ve written about louie’s new gal pals moving into the neighborhood  louie’s getting to know rambunctious puppies  and his tolerance (or occasional intolerance) of guests in our home. you’ve been introduced to his chest-bumping pal  mick  his walking buddy sully and his steady girls eve and ellie. but we’ve not talked about sampson much. that’s because there’s not much to talk about. sampson (or sammy) is just a steady as you go  no drama kind of pup. and louie loves that because louie needs steady and stable..louie and sammy met a few years ago. sampson is an adorable pug who is occasionally stubborn while walking with his mom. but louie rarely sees that side of sammy. the pups happily acknowledge each other and then just walk side by side. sammy waddles  louie prances  and the pace seems to work for them both..lou can be who he is when he’s with sampson. he can just simply be. it’s almost as though he lets out a long sigh and says  “hey buddy.” and then they just walk together. they don’t romp around or chase each other. they just stroll..while i have many friends and family members who love me just as i am  my lifetime friend gina has known me since the day i was born. our parents were friends long before we came along and despite their moving to l.a. when gina and i were three  our parents remained friends and my friendship with gina deepened over the years. to this day  gina and i talk regularly and visit as often as possible..the best thing about gina is that i can be my authentic self with her. i don’t have to perform or jump through hoops or pretend or walk on egg shells. i learned about the power of vulnerability decades ago because my friendship with gina helped me see the areas in my life that kept me from being real. it wasn’t a book or a training session or a counselor  although those are great tools. it was the power of relationship that brought me to where i am today..much like louie and sampson  gina and i don’t have to be talking to feel close and can simply bask in the golden silence of true friendship. we have shared life’s sorrows including death of loved ones  divorce  remarriage and we’ve shared life’s joys such as the birth of each other’s children. we can call at 3 a.m. and one of us will answer the phone with  “what’s wrong?” we’ve been through sickness  job promotions  sixty birthdays and many kauai sunsets. through thick and thin  we will always be best friends..i know gina loves me enough to address a character flaw she may see in me long before others do. i trust her to be honest and caring  so i welcome her feedback. some leaders think they are above feedback but without it  they can end up with negative consequences that affect their relationships as well as their job performance. we all need friends in our lives who act as a stopgap to our bad behavioral choices. and we must be willing to listen..every leader needs a gina! and every leader needs to hear when their gina says  “i’m not sure about that.” just as every louie needs a sampson  a steady as you go  let’s walk side by side pal who cares more about you than they do themselves. these kinds of friends truly enrich our lives and make us better people  leaders…or pets!.me and gina (left)  1956 (and my sister donna 🙂.me and gina–still crazy after all these

2017 may 8  2017 by danisedistasi.it’s not been that long since louie’s friend sammy passed. every time we walk by sammy’s home  louie will check out the stake in the ground and attached leash or scope out a lingering smell that i’m sure reminds him of his friend. i can’t help but wonder what he remembers and what he thinks as he looks toward sammy’s front door. does he wonder why he hasn’t seen his friend in a while  or does he somehow know sammy won’t be coming out to play? he seems satisfied with the little reminders of sammy as we move on with our walk..i know louie has a great memory because of all the issues we’ve dealt with over the years in getting him to think differently about people coming to the door  the smell of cigars  or other triggers. i’m sure he remembers sammy prancing outside to play  allie greeting him with lots of kisses  and khaki regally sitting atop the hill  waiting for sir louie to arrive. the little reminders of his friends who have passed on seem to fill louie’s heart and spirit with joy and fondness..sometimes we humans tend to rush right past those reminders because we don’t want to dwell in the past  or it may be too painful to park there a moment. but they are nestled in our memories and  many times  those reminders are necessary for our well-being..i recently visited my brother and his family in phoenix and had the pleasure of bringing my granddaughter evi with me. what a joy! in addition to the beauty of arizona  we really enjoyed visiting mark  agnes  and christian. more times than not i would look across the table at evi and swear i was looking at her mother  my daughter  marisa. mark and i both caught ourselves calling evi by the endearing name my family calls marisa—rissy!.what sparked this thirty-year lapse in memory? the twinkle in evi’s eyes  her contagious laugh  the way she holds her hand up to her mouth as she tells a story  her facial expressions  and her tone of voice. her face alone is a replica of marisa’s—oh  the little reminders..but it goes deeper. i see my mom in so many ways when i look at marisa and evi! and when mea  my youngest granddaughter  crinkles her nose when she laughs  i see a glimpse of my mom who did the same thing. all these reminders fill my heart with lifelong memories. those memories open the door to a better understanding of the wisdom that has been passed down through the years. i hear my mom’s voice as i am reminded of the life lessons i’ve learned that have been passed to my daughter and now to her daughters—wisdom like this:.you can do whatever you’d like as long as you understand the consequences and are willing to face them (i wish i would have listened to that wisdom a bit more carefully)..you don’t need a thousand friends (and this before facebook). you do need a few good close friends (two to four) with whom you can trust and share life..look people in the eyes; show them they matter..never be so upset with someone that you won’t say hello (a kind and genuine hello) to him or her in public..family matters..whether across the table in phoenix or every time my brothers and sisters share funny stories of our youth with my granddaughters  evi and mea  i see my mom and i hear her voice. through such small and seemingly irrelevant reminders  my heart soars to the heights of a lifelong memory of my mother. i have been blessed that my mom spent significant time with marisa before she passed. and now i am blessed to share life with my daughter and grandchildren and to watch marisa blossom into a wonderful  loving mother..yes  i am sure louie relishes the little reminders of his dear friends who have passed on  and it must bring him joy as he taps into a lifelong memory. i see the joy by the way he walks and even in his face. and i have to smile every time i know louie is enjoying a wonderful memory..don’t rush by the little reminders that pop up in the daily haste to the next thing. you’ll be missing a soul refresher  a spark of a wonderful  lifelong memory. and in our hurried world  we all need these refreshing little reminders..happy mother’s day to all the moms making memories (doggie moms included)..mick reminding louie it is good to slow down!.for louie’s faithful friends…thank you!!.louie’s newly revised leadership book is available for 50% off.click on the image below and use this

louie. while we’ve learned a tremendous amount and understand each other’s idiosyncrasies  there are a few behaviors of his that still puzzle me..for example  i never know which humans he will growl at or who will get a tail wag from him. since being together for over three years  i’ve concluded there is no rhyme or reason to his selection process. and then it hit me one morning as i was going through the avalanche of messages i received while being out of the office for a few days. quite a few were from people i didn’t know from companies i wasn’t familiar with..we’ve all received emails  voice mails  or linkedin messages with the greeting of hey [insert your name here]! it’s not the “hey  danise” that irks me; it’s the fact that i don’t know these people  and yet they act like we’re good buddies. as they continue their message  i start mentally clicking through my contacts trying to recall a chance meeting we may have had. by the message i received  you would think we were long lost friends. it is a marketing tactic that is running rampant in today’s social media world of superficial relationships..it may just be me  but this tactic shuts down any possibility of that person being heard because i have a belief that the messenger  though he or she may have great information  is probably not being authentic. while i am perfectly okay with people using informal greetings  i am not okay with people acting like they know me when we’ve never connected..louie is no different. when someone he does not know approaches him  talks sweet  and acts like they are friends  he becomes very leery of them. children are the only exception to his rule. granted  louie is cute  and everyone wants to talk to him. but if he doesn’t know them and senses something uncomfortable about them  he will lower his head and step to the side as if to move out of their reach. if that doesn’t work  he will back up and bark at them..his message is clear . . . don’t act like you know me when you don’t!.i learned this lesson the hard way over twenty-five years ago. the medical imaging equipment company i worked for acquired a small but very technically advanced company. along with that acquisition came a regional manager  joe  who became my boss. joe recommended that i connect with a friend of his  wendell  at a hospital in louisville. i called wendell on his private line  and he picked up on the first ring with a very gruff  “hello!”.i cleared my throat  and in my perky salesgirl voice  i said  “hi  wendell. this is danise distasi. joe hartzog suggested that i reach out to you. how are you today?”.“fine!”.i cleared my throat a second time. “great. well  wendell  i’m sure you’re busy  so i’ll—”.“excuse me  young lady! do i know you?”.“hmmm  well  uh  i don’t believe we’ve met  have we? i think we may only know each other through joe.”.“i don’t know you at all. why do you think you can call me by my first name? i’d prefer to be addressed as dr. tyson.”.needless to say  there were a few awkward moments after that announcement  and the recovery was tough. but i understood dr. tyson loud and clear. my boss  joe  never addressed him as dr. tyson  only wendell. i assumed it was okay for me to address him that way as well  even though we had never met. this was a classic case of being ill-prepared. and dr. tyson saw right through me. he didn’t know me  and me thinking that i had an “in” was not going to work with him..while we may prefer to be immediately relational  what must come first is authenticity  which goes a long way with louie and with humans. dogs are incredibly sensitive to people being who they “say” they are  but we humans have to work a bit harder to figure out who people really are. the tactic of someone acting like they know us defies our basic human need of wanting to be truly known and  even deeper  to be known and loved. the superficiality of today is leaving a relational void in so many people’s lives..i believe it is best to be authentic in every aspect of your life. brené brown talks about this in her famous ted talk about the power of vulnerability. the people she studied who seemed to have a strong sense of love and belonging shared these three things:.courage.compassion.authenticity.in her words  “these folks had the courage to be imperfect. they had a connection as a result of authenticity. they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they are.”.what you see is what you get when you connect with louie: no pretenses  no games—just the real deal. he expects that in return from the humans he comes in contact with  and he is confused when he senses otherwise. thanks to louie  i have learned to let go of who i thought i should be in order to be who i really am..*********************.louie had to say goodbye to his lifelong buddy  sampson  this weekend. sammy was a great pal to louie and was the real deal. we will always remember the fun walks and visits we had with him. louie will miss seeing and playing with him  as will everyone in our neighborhood. run and jump  little sampson. you’re bound by nothing that will ever hold you back from being the

exited the garage  i ran into a neighbor and we started chatting. louie patiently waited for us to finish with his typical signals: he lowered his head and looked at the person interrupting our time together with an under the brow look and a quick whine. i usually ignore him..but after a few minutes  i noticed he was alert to something. his body language signaled an issue that i had no clue about. he stood up straight  his ears perked up  and he intently stared in the direction across the street. his awareness is a great tool when we are walking in the dark because he gives me a heads up that someone is walking toward us..since i wasn’t paying attention to these visible signs  he began “pointing” by holding his paw up in the air in the direction he wanted me to look. this is a comical stance because as his legs are so short  they barely move when he points; but he did his best..louie has a keen sense of discernment and can immediately tell the difference between friend or foe. by his stance  i could clearly tell a foe was approaching. but other than my neighbor  there was no human or canine in sight. still  he continued to stare and point. finally  after carefully canvassing the entire community within eyesight  i saw what he was signaling to me. over the hill of a neighbor’s yard  the tip of a dog’s head was visible with his eyes barely showing. this was not just any dog  but his new nemesis  oliver..we quickly scooted across the street and headed out on our long walk to avoid any further distractions. as we walked  i thought of louie’s incredible awareness and how it ties into his keen sense of discernment. but there is one thing he is lacking in the awareness arena that is key to being an effective relational leader: self-awareness. louie has little to no self-awareness; but as leaders  we must develop this essential behavior..what is self-awareness and why is it such an elusive leadership behavior? according to merriam-webster’s definition  it is an awareness of one’s own personality or individuality. to this definition  i would add “flaws and all!” few leaders practice self-awareness because there is a mindset that says  “don’t be too introspective; keep moving ahead; don’t be too concerned about what other’s think of you.”.there is some validity in that advice  but as in everything  we need to balance that information. here are a few characteristics of relational leaders who are self-aware:.they know themselves well..they are always seeking and welcome feedback. they are not quick to make excuses or justifications when honest feedback is given..they are aware of the traits that hold them back  and take action to address them..they are conscious of their weaknesses and look to hire people who perform well in the areas where they lack expertise..they are natural delegators..they read people well (louie does this also. maybe he is more self-aware than i give him credit for)..self-awareness is key to our emotional health and the relational health of our team. it is actually freeing when you recognize the areas that are holding you back and release them so that others can step up to the plate and excel in their strengths..ask others to assist you in becoming more self-aware. the growth potential for not only you as a leader but for your team as well is astonishing and rewarding by way of a healthy culture and employee engagement..for now  i am still impressed with louie’s awareness of his environment. his self-awareness probably extends to his level of insecurities and fears only…but it’s a start!.monday  march 20  2017  is louie’s 5th birthday. my granddaughters decided his birthday should always be on the first day of spring because he is so full of life! send him an email to wish him

long walks and enjoying our time together. louie is a pretty happy pup lately and trots down the street with a prance that matches his joyful heart..but then there’s this girl. you see  she’s absolutely beautiful with striking white fur and pale-blue eyes lined in black. she’s a tall  slim husky/shepherd mix  and louie is not quite sure what to think of her. apparently  she is also confused about him when they pass on the street..you lookin’ at me?.in his usual tough guy style  he gives her a look that says  “are you lookin’ at me? uh  you lookin’ at me?”.she then stands a little taller and looks down at him as if to say  “what are you talking about? you’re lookin’ at me!” he puffs his chest out and she pushes her nose at him  and before you know it they are huffing and puffing and challenging one another. with a slight tug on his leash and my usual command to “leave it ” we continue on our walk..now these two have had great interactions before  and  based on louie’s body language and tone of voice  he’s not aggressively challenging her. but i find it interesting that his bad behavior provokes her bad behavior and  if allowed  it may escalate to a more serious challenge..i noticed this too with his little buddy  mac. louie typically ignores him  but when mac is unusually “active ” louie seems to chime right in and become an obnoxious pup by playing rough (with me  not another dog) or ignoring me when it is time to settle down..our work teams are very similar. although a smile or a word of affirmation from a coworker can spread good cheer in the workplace  bad behavior and rudeness are also contagious. being rude or impolite to your coworkers can lead them to behave the same way  negatively affecting our culture and productivity..as leaders  rudeness should not be tolerated in our work or homes. while there may be many reasons for someone to be in a bad mood and react negatively  it is our responsibility as leaders to demonstrate that even under unpleasant circumstances it is never okay to be rude and disrespectful. so what are we to do?.it seems the “leave it” command works well for louie  and it works well for me  too. “leave it” doesn’t mean to ignore the situation and hope it goes away. it simply means to not dwell on it and let the emotion subside. oswald chambers  an early twentieth-century scottish theologian and teacher  said over a century ago  “there is always at least one more fact  which we know nothing about  in every person’s situation.”.this is a good time to revisit the paws method. when someone is rude and your first inclination is to become upset and respond rudely  try this method to help you analyze the situation before doing something you may regret:.pause—breathe! allow oxygen to get to your brain. you may need to walk away for a bit and then revisit the situation. there is power in the pause. when we pause before speaking  we gain time to process our thoughts..ask questions: “what’s going on?” “can you tell me more?” “can you help me understand?” “is everything okay?” ask yourself these things: is there something else going on in this person’s life? what’s going on with me? why does this aggravate me? reflect on your answers before you speak..wisdom: choose your words wisely. i would much rather have people feel uncomfortable waiting for me to find the right words than allowing myself to get sucked into poor behavior. carefully consider the words you are about to say. if they are not life-giving  do not say them. nothing good comes from useless  mindless words..seek to understand: once you pause  ask questions  and choose your words wisely  you will naturally seek to understand. remember  everyone has “stuff” in his or her backgrounds. and so do you!.there is no reason to tolerate rudeness in our workplace  and studies have shown that bad behavior begets bad behavior. we have a responsibility as leaders to stop that behavior in order to maintain or restore a healthy culture..as for louie and his beautiful tall cool blonde friend  i think they may secretly like each other. i may have to help him a bit with showing girls his interest. so far he’s not scoring any points  but i still love him..my bad little dog  talented as he may be. he actually pulled a towel out of the laundry basket and somehow wrapped himself in it and settled in for a nap!.click here to

over the past few weeks. but since i would rather hear “wow  you’re doing so well” than “oh  gee  sorry you’re still struggling with your recovery ” the thought passed quickly  never to return..because i’m ready to close the chapter on my accident and subsequent surgery  my passing thought is not what the subject line is referring to. this is a blog about my persnickety pup louie and his ever-increasing need to whine. while i know he suffered trauma over the past couple of months along with me  his whining seems to have increased exponentially rather than to have subsided as i would have expected. i soon discovered his behavior has nothing to do with my injury. instead  louie is reacting to a new dog in the neighborhood..this new dog represents everything louie hates. the dog is a male  he’s bigger than lou  and he’s . . . shhhh . . . not neutered. the last issue sends louie into a tizzy even before we walk out the door. his hackles go up  and he puffs out his chest and huffs as he walks out. but then the incessant whining begins. and once he starts that  it’s tough to get him to stop..one morning as we exited the garage  we made a sharp left turn out of our driveway and hurried away from where the dog lives as quickly as a girl with a cane can manage. louie looked back  whined  and seemed disoriented. i tugged on his collar and gave a stern command  “leave it ” which he immediately obeyed  but his memory is keen  and it quickly took him back to the dark side. i was hoping he would find a new smell to distract him..thanks to zig our dog trainer  i learned a long time ago that louie whines out of fear  so i have to step up and walk with confidence. that’s tough to do considering i’m still healing  but i did the best i could. louie suspiciously eyed the cane  and then looked back at me with a face that said he was not convinced i could protect us both . . . and i didn’t blame him..as our walk settled into a more relaxed pace  i reflected on why some people  like louie  seem to whine so much. do you have a few whiners on your team? it’s easy to get frustrated and dismiss them  but there is usually something deeper going on that we may never uncover unless we take the time to do so..fear is a big issue for louie  which is why he whines. fear is a big issue for people as well and could be the reason some folks whine. i have learned to counter louie’s fear  not with my confidence but with love. love is the first step of the louie leadership model:.love is foundational to building trust and integrity for a personal or professional relationship to flourish. without love and trust  our relationships are like fragile shells that have nothing inside of them and with the slightest amount of pressure  are easily shattered. because of the love i have demonstrated for louie on a regular basis  he has learned to trust me. [for more on leading with trust  see this article by my friend  randy conley  vice president of client services & trust practice leader for the ken blanchard companies.].a teammate may whine because the team is experiencing a daunting and uncomfortable change. loving people through such change does not mean we coddle them. it means we shed light on the situation  we share the truth  and we press through together..love is more impactful than complaining to others that someone is a whiner..our society tends to misuse the word love. in fact  very few understand the strength and character it takes to love others. we have fluffy commercials about it  emoticons  and facebook posts. martin luther king  jr. said  “darkness cannot drive out darkness  only light can do that. hate cannot drive out hate  only love can do that.”.and who can argue with this verse: “such love has no fear because perfect love expels all fear. if we are afraid  it is for fear of punishment  and this shows that we have not fully experienced his (god’s) perfect love.”.i doubt louie will be able to love the new dog in the neighborhood anytime soon. in fact  i’m sure he is hoping the dog moves away. in the meantime  i’m working on loving lou through this ordeal and rebuilding his confidence and trust in me so he knows i will never allow another dog to threaten him..but louie is a dog and as humans  we can choose to love. you can be the change agent for someone by removing fear of punishment or detrimental consequences and instilling love instead. such love is the gateway to experiencing god’s perfect love and the cornerstone on which excellent and effective leadership is built..note: my friend t.d. hughes knows how emphatic i am about leadership and love and recently sent me an article i thought you would enjoy as well. it’s okay to love your employees.**speaking of love  louie sends his love for a wonderful valentine’s day**.picture compliments of louie’s favorite place  best

that means!.january 24  2017 january 24  2017 by danisedistasi.our last blog detailed a journey i’m glad to say i am more than halfway through. if all goes well  my release date from all restrictions is february 1  2017. i am off all pain medication  and i took my first solo drive yesterday. i am beginning to see some normalcy slowly trickle back into my life. again  i am completely humbled by the continued outpouring of love and encouragement. thank you!.and then  there’s louie! louie was as traumatized as i was through this journey. he had to adjust to my being gone for two weeks; friends coming and going  walking and feeding him  playing with him  all while he constantly watched the door with the hope i would walk through it any minute..now that i’m home and he’s learned to trust my erratic movements with a cane  he seems to have settled back into some interesting habits: growling at people who come to my door (even his dog walkers) and jumping on the couch to sit directly across from me (better to watch me  he says)..one evening  a friend came by to take louie for a walk. after they finished and she came in to sit with me for awhile  he ran into the house  checked on me  and then ran upstairs  where he ran the length of the hallway several times. then  i heard a big commotion  and from where i was sitting  i could tell what that little rascal was doing. he was getting into my clothesbasket in my bathroom and taking all the clothes out of it  having no consideration whatsoever for the amount of time it took me to get the clothes into that basket..his continued motion  which was evident even though he was a floor above me  indicated he not only removed the items from the basket  he was also rolling in them—all of them! some time ago  i explained to zig  our trainer  louie’s annoying bad habit of rolling in the dirty laundry. i assumed it was because he wanted to surround himself with my smell  weird as that is..but zig assured me that was not it at all. louie was getting his smell on my clothes  showing his dominance over me. what? now that is a really annoying bad habit that makes me realize we are back to square one. there will be no dominance of louie over me..but this is not surprising. when it takes all my energy to walk from the living room to the kitchen  disciplining a dog is not high on my list  especially since we’ve been through this before. the pressure was off of louie to behave well  and when the pressure is off  he reverts back to his old habits..that is so like us. a while ago  i wrote a blog about something i learned from my time with the ken blanchard companies about the dynamics of change. one dynamic is that when the pressure is off  we revert to our original behaviors. well  the pressure was definitely off  and louie was back to some of his old habits. we will need to spend time correcting that. but rather than lament  i reflected on what this means as far as my recent journey and getting “back to normal.”.finally being able to drive did give me a sense of life getting back to normal. getting off medication  walking better  and looking forward to some normalcy were great goals for recovery. but did i really want normalcy to be my goal?.not this time  not this year. i am going to be intentional (keeping the pressure on) about breaking past the norm to live a well-meaning life by doing the following:.pruning activities  objects  and even some relationships  all to devote precious time to what matters;.being kind in thought  word  and deed  whether people deserve it or not. i don’t mean just merely being nice (and sometimes superficial and phony)  but being authentic and loving—speaking truth in love and showing those who differ from me  or have differing viewpoints  the compassion that only comes from faith in god;.taking time to listen in order to learn—and not rushing to the next project;.being still and having plenty of margin in my life;.laughing more; and.dancing (okay  that one is normal for me  but now takes on an even more special meaning). i will take time to dance more with my grandchildren and even my adult daughter because that’s what distasi kids do. my niece sara is getting married in september  and she has promised we will dance the night away. that is my goal for 2017..be intentional about breaking past the norm. life is too short and too easily interrupted for us to stay stuck in the status quo. and you are never too old to take that first step to crashing through the “same ol’  same ol’.”.as for louie  we have some work to do. as i have been writing  he slipped into my laundry room and pulled out a dishtowel. he is so bad. i know he has a large fan base of people who love him  but this annoying little habit just makes me shake my head. i suppose being intentionally kind starts now with little louie distasi!.click the cover to order louie’s leadership legacy book..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble

danisedistasi.today was the first day i was able to wrap my arms around louie and give him a huge bear hug. it was three weeks ago that i had an accident and our lives quickly changed. and in celebrating my ability to hug him and receive an under the neck snuggle from him  i thought it fitting to resume our blog after an unintentionally extended vacation..december 18  2016  was filled with great anticipation. it was one week before christmas  and the distasi family was planning to gather at my house to celebrate christmas. everything was set; the massive amounts of food  the decorations  gifts  and music. it was to be a celebration to top all the ones we had celebrated so far as a family..louie and i took our usual stroll early that morning. two days before  there had been a late evening ice storm  but this particular morning seemed okay as far as icy pavement was concerned. still  i was cautious and walked in the grass as much as possible..an elderly neighbor has a very long driveway  and louie and i had been taking her daily newspaper to her so she would not have to venture out and lean over to pick it up. as soon as i stepped on the driveway  my feet flew up in the air  and i landed on my left hip. i lost control of louie  and it took me a few moments to catch my breath. i couldn’t see louie  and panic was about to set in. his normal reaction when something startles him is to run away. and seeing his mama flying through the air had to have been startling..i forced myself to turn as far to the left as i could. there louie sat  close behind my left shoulder. i reached around to draw him close to me. as he tucked his head under my arm  i felt his shaking and heard him whimper. to hear him cry broke my heart  and my tears started to flow uncontrollably. i knew i could not move—and whatever would take place from that moment forward  it would be a long journey. louie chose to stay by me as the faithful friend that he is..a neighbor pulled up with his phone in hand  already calling 911  and i called my friend and neighbor cindy to pick up louie. i called my daughter  marisa  and the network of community  family  and friends jumped into action. everyone’s life was interrupted on december 18  2016..after a jarring ambulance ride  surgery to repair a femur that was fractured in two places  a total hip replacement  five days in the hospital  and physical therapy  i was released to marisa and matt’s home for respite care and to celebrate christmas with the two cutest nurses on the face of the earth. louie had been well taken care of by my wonderful neighbors who had walked him  let him stay in their homes  taken him to daycare to play  and given him more love than he could imagine..life interrupted has taught louie and me a few things:.we appreciate life and the little things: although that seems so cliché  it was the small steps of accomplishment that filled me with joy. every day  i set new goals to accomplish—goals i never would have dreamed to set before. for instance  i learned to get out of bed  to go to the bathroom  and to take my meds without having to wake my daughter to help me. and to carry a cup of coffee in the morning to enjoy my quiet time. mea and evi helped me do things as they watched me improve. christmas had a deeper meaning this year with sincere thankfulness  love  and joy!.you really do know who your friends are: so many people dropped everything to help. it was a terrible strain on marisa and matt as they took care of me. so many friends offered to grocery shop  run errands  and stay with me when i finally came home. my sisters and cousin packed their clothes and took turns staying overnight. my brothers were calling  visiting  and bringing food. the neighbors who took care of louie were such godsends. many people could not help because of logistics  but they checked in and prayed..you have to move out of your comfort zone: this was a tough one for louie and me. i had to let people help me. what a humbling position to be in; i was helpless. i have never stayed in a hospital other than to give birth. i don’t take any medicines  and i have never fractured a single bone. the outpouring of love and encouragement has been overwhelming. louie had to be comfortable with people coming and going in and out of our home and driving him to and from daycare. but we both pressed on through pain  frustration  fear  and being uncomfortable. it was difficult  but i believe we made it past the hardest part of this process. there’s still much more healing to take place and there will always be a next move out of our comfort zone. i have no doubt we’ll press through that too..some things just do not matter: the superficiality of the holidays clashed with the richness of genuine  loving relationships. there can be no comparison of the things that are bought with the things that are sought  caught  and taught. the characteristics of love  joy  and peace are important for us to live and pass on to others. it takes effort  but it is worth the time and effort. i am a better person because of the love  joy  and peace that others shared with me this season..2017 is going to be a great year of love and strength. louie is a better dog because he chose faithfulness over running away. he trusted and allowed others into his world to help us! we are closer because of these last few weeks. thank you to so many for being in my life and for your prayers and support!.click here to sign up for louie’s email list..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and

expectancy.december 12  2016 december 13  2016 by danisedistasi.louie  my adopted pup  and i were walking on a beautiful fall day when we saw one of his pug buddies—or so we thought. his friend sammy is a tan and black pug with a unique characteristic: his tongue protrudes ever so slightly. i recognized that the person walking him was not his owner. that’s not unusual since many of us in the community need others to walk our dogs on occasion. louie was excited to see his buddy and could hardly wait to romp and play..as we approached  i asked if the dog was sammy  because he had the same markings and same characteristic of a slightly protruding tongue. the person walking him said no. but louie quickly ran up to the sammy look-alike; it did not take him long to realize this was not his buddy  and then he became indignant as if he was mad at the pug for not being sammy..we quickly said our good-byes while louie kicked up his feet and snarled just to make sure the dog understood he was not even close to being sammy..i realized louie’s expectations for playing with his friend were unmet  and disappointment had set in quickly. based on all appearances  louie was expecting to have fun and play  but that expectation was not to be filled that day..this time of year  the majority of us have many expectations that  when unmet for whatever reason  will disappoint us. people have a hard time moving on from such setbacks. i think these disappointments occur because we’ve set ourselves up for failure when we box up our expectations in the hopes that they will be fulfilled..instead  what if we had a spirit of expectancy? you may wonder what the difference is between having expectations and having a spirit of expectancy. a spirit of expectancy is what very young children usually possess. they have the mindset that something wonderful is about to happen  but with no expectation of specifics. while they may wish for something on their christmas list  it is their heart of expectancy that is truly magical. it is the hopefulness of something wonderful. for me  that may entail time with my family  but without expectation that the time meets any specific criteria—it is simply time together..another example occurred on the holiest of nights. for centuries  people expected the messiah to come amongst their midst. in this expectation  they envisioned a king  surrounded by throngs of noble men and women and trumpets blaring. because of these expectations they missed the wonder of all that took place on that quiet  serene night when the stars were brightly shining..yet only those with a spirit of expectancy  whose hearts were open to the wonder of what only the creator of the universe could put into action  witnessed the birth of the king in a simple  lowly manger..expectations for particular things and events always run the risk of disappointing us  since many times  events and what others do are out of our control. as we wind down our year  rather than focusing on the disappointments of unmet expectations  let’s look forward with a heart of expectancy and see if that doesn’t lighten our spirits with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen..while louie experienced disappointment by not having his expectations met with the look-alike sammy  it did not dampen his spirit of expectancy. he still walks out of our home with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen. something as simple as seeing a dear neighbor who pats him on the head or gives him belly rubs lends to his heart of wonder..click the image for

november 29  2016 by danisedistasi.the subject line might offend louie. in fact  it might offend you as well. but let’s face it—in the heat of the recent political battle  many of us are shaking our heads while trying to understand what just happened. one thing i do know is that disrespect for people with differing opinions is at an all-time high..the rude rhetoric on all sides of the political spectrum gave me pause and made me think of louie and some of his not-so-friendly foes. i am convinced that if people were to act the way our pets do  we would all get along better. for example  sometimes louie might see a dog that challenges him. the two will snarl and growl and perhaps even bark at each other. however  the minute we walk side by side with the dog and its owner  they seem to get along. there is something about being intentional and walking alongside someone you have a disagreement with..louie has done this with my niece’s dog  buddy. those two little boys will scrunch their noses  curl their lips  show their teeth  stand their hair up  and bark in such a high pitch that people turn their heads with a look of concern. andrea laughs  assuring everyone in sight that the dogs are actually cousins and are fine with each other. it sure doesn’t seem like it when they are facing one another. however  as soon as we start walking  they are fine together..louie also behaves this way with rambunctious claire  his other cousin noli  his neighbor snickers  and a new boxer in the community named socks. what is it about being side by side with their supposed nemesis? i think there are several things:.it is less threatening..they are on equal ground..they see the same vision of what lies ahead..they walk with the same pace..it is easier to carry the other’s burden. (okay  this one relates to humans  not louie.).what if some of our leaders were intentional about walking side by side instead of duking it out? i am reminded of an article i wrote in 2005 when i worked with ken blanchard titled “leading with your heart takes humility.” although it was written over eleven years ago  the premise holds true today: humility is the key to excelling in leadership. and servant leaders are humble enough to walk beside someone they disagree with..i won’t share the full article here (you can find it at this link)  but here are some of the highlights:.something is glaringly missing from leadership today. sadly  many leadership programs are missing just one key ingredient: the heart. not just the heart of the issue or the heart of the matter—the heart of the people..what gets in your way? what truly is your motive for being a leader or wanting to lead others? is it for selfish gain or to better others?.many times  our ego gets in the way and what bubbles up out of our hearts are things like pride  selfishness  and even fear..how can you push past what holds you back? in getting past the barriers  is the challenge as a leader to balance confidence with humility to fight ego issues? ken blanchard often uses the quote  “humility is not thinking less of yourself. it’s thinking of yourself less.” every time you make a leadership decision  are you thinking of yourself or others?.confidence does not come from being in a dominant position and leading by intimidation. doing this will cause you to lose respect from others  and any talk about values or integrity will be ignored. humility  however  is not something they teach us in business schools. it is a character trait that is honed over time with truth and love..our businesses  organizations  and families are hungry for leadership coupled with humility. it takes commitment to make the necessary changes to have a healthy culture and humble leaders..perhaps our world could learn a lesson from louie about being intentional and walking side by side with others rather than snarling at them. while louie doesn’t understand humility  his actions speak louder than his woof. he is more than willing to walk alongside others. as i watch his actions  i am convinced that we humans have much to learn from our dogs..louie’s newest revision is now available. click on the book to order..click here to sign up for louie’s email distribution!.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  conflict  consistency  courage  fear and pride  forgiveness  fundamentals in leadership  gossip  healthy culture  honesty  ken blanchard  leadership  moral compromise  relationships  respect  servant leadership  trust  truth tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  #pridegetsintheway  #toughlessons  danise distasi  distasi advisors  healthy cultures  healthy relationships  louie's leadership lessons  realational leadership 2 comments.you can’t make me something i don’t want to be!.november 13  2016 november 15  2016 by danisedistasi.louie was not having it. he planted all four paws on the floor and would not move an inch. his face let me know he was not pleased. at all..“louie ” i said sternly as i tried to squeeze his 40 pounds of muscle where it didn’t want to go. “this is only for two hours  if that. surely you can oblige me.”.i sat back and stared at him  exasperated. for the last few halloweens  i’ve donned a cruella de vil look and spent the evening with my grandchildren. this year i thought it would be fun to take louie along in a dalmatian outfit. except there were no dalmatian costumes for dogs. the closest thing i could find was a child’s costume for a spotted cow..i had imagined how it would turn out. louie might not share my enthusiasm for this creative costume. but he’d forget all about it when he set eyes on my granddaughters  evi and mea. he’d jump out of the car and happily trot with them along the street  greeting other children  trying to get a peek into their candy loot. i just knew louie would have more fun than he could imagine if he could just push through wearing a silly cow outfit and look as much like a dalmatian as he could..i also imagined it would make a great blog lesson: all about pressing through uncomfortable situations to enjoy the outcome. sounds good  right?.being someone we’re not.but none of that happened. yes  lou was happy to see evi and mea. he did enjoy it when other children came up to love on him. but he hated his costume and was mad at me the entire time. he wouldn’t even pose for a picture  and believe me  that’s not like him..i finally took the costume off and let him be louie..too often we find ourselves being something we don’t want to be. maybe it’s of our own doing — because we think we need to fit in  and it requires being someone “different.” but often it’s because someone else expects us to be different than what we are..maybe it’s a negative thing: a boss requires us to be something based on their own insecurities. or maybe it’s positive: a leader sees potential in us that we don’t see or can even imagine  and they want to coach us to be better..no matter the reason  we resist because it is uncomfortable to be something we are not. we don’t want to don a costume and fake it..can’t make anyone change.it’s tough to balance being authentic and at the same time develop beyond mediocrity toward excellence. it can feel like donning a facade and “faking it till we make it.” what should leaders do to help folks grow?.if you’re in a position of leadership  you can suggest someone continue to develop. you can provide tools  mentoring  and ongoing training. but you can’t make them be something they don’t want to be. each person is responsible for taking that first step to wanting to make significant changes in their lives..still  there are ways to influence those in whom you see potential. for example:.watch to see whether the person shows an eagerness to learn and grow  i.e.  reading books and asking for help..ask them where do they see themselves going? what is their end goal?.share with them what potential you see in them..be sure your expectations align with their skillset and desires..if their end goal and desires outweigh their skillset  place them on a realistic development plan and be clear about expectations..greater than they imagine.when louie and i arrived back home  he was one tired pup. he slinked upstairs to his little bed to lay down. his expression told me he was still traumatized by the costume. but as i knelt down to give him a kiss  i looked into his eyes and saw a little spark..it was a look that said  “if you are trying to make me be something different than who i am  at least make me a lion!”.and with that  he tucked his head into the fold of his front paw and fell fast asleep. no doubt  that evening he dreamt of being a lion..louie the lion…hear me roar!.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  fundamentals in leadership  healthy culture  honesty  leadership  moral compromise  people process differently  relationships  respect  the louie model  the paws model  transparency  trust  unmet expectations tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  #louiesleadershiplessons  healthy relationships  hope love  leadership  trust leave a comment.post navigation.older posts.newer posts.← previous 1 2 3 4 … 8 next →.subscribe to blog via email.enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email..email address	.search for:.recent posts.time to say goodbye may 22  2020.when the world was silent may 14  2020.back to normal?

dog trainer,be authentic – page 3 – unleash love.skip to content	.menu	.lead like louie blog.eradicating bullying from the classroom to the boardroom.be authentic	.don’t hey me!.april 25  2017 april 25  2017 by danisedistasi.oh  the lessons i continue to discover thanks to my adopted pup louie. while we’ve learned a tremendous amount and understand each other’s idiosyncrasies  there are a few behaviors of his that still puzzle me..for example  i never know which humans he will growl at or who will get a tail wag from him. since being together for over three years  i’ve concluded there is no rhyme or reason to his selection process. and then it hit me one morning as i was going through the avalanche of messages i received while being out of the office for a few days. quite a few were from people i didn’t know from companies i wasn’t familiar with..we’ve all received emails  voice mails  or linkedin messages with the greeting of hey [insert your name here]! it’s not the “hey  danise” that irks me; it’s the fact that i don’t know these people  and yet they act like we’re good buddies. as they continue their message  i start mentally clicking through my contacts trying to recall a chance meeting we may have had. by the message i received  you would think we were long lost friends. it is a marketing tactic that is running rampant in today’s social media world of superficial relationships..it may just be me  but this tactic shuts down any possibility of that person being heard because i have a belief that the messenger  though he or she may have great information  is probably not being authentic. while i am perfectly okay with people using informal greetings  i am not okay with people acting like they know me when we’ve never connected..louie is no different. when someone he does not know approaches him  talks sweet  and acts like they are friends  he becomes very leery of them. children are the only exception to his rule. granted  louie is cute  and everyone wants to talk to him. but if he doesn’t know them and senses something uncomfortable about them  he will lower his head and step to the side as if to move out of their reach. if that doesn’t work  he will back up and bark at them..his message is clear . . . don’t act like you know me when you don’t!.i learned this lesson the hard way over twenty-five years ago. the medical imaging equipment company i worked for acquired a small but very technically advanced company. along with that acquisition came a regional manager  joe  who became my boss. joe recommended that i connect with a friend of his  wendell  at a hospital in louisville. i called wendell on his private line  and he picked up on the first ring with a very gruff  “hello!”.i cleared my throat  and in my perky salesgirl voice  i said  “hi  wendell. this is danise distasi. joe hartzog suggested that i reach out to you. how are you today?”.“fine!”.i cleared my throat a second time. “great. well  wendell  i’m sure you’re busy  so i’ll—”.“excuse me  young lady! do i know you?”.“hmmm  well  uh  i don’t believe we’ve met  have we? i think we may only know each other through joe.”.“i don’t know you at all. why do you think you can call me by my first name? i’d prefer to be addressed as dr. tyson.”.needless to say  there were a few awkward moments after that announcement  and the recovery was tough. but i understood dr. tyson loud and clear. my boss  joe  never addressed him as dr. tyson  only wendell. i assumed it was okay for me to address him that way as well  even though we had never met. this was a classic case of being ill-prepared. and dr. tyson saw right through me. he didn’t know me  and me thinking that i had an “in” was not going to work with him..while we may prefer to be immediately relational  what must come first is authenticity  which goes a long way with louie and with humans. dogs are incredibly sensitive to people being who they “say” they are  but we humans have to work a bit harder to figure out who people really are. the tactic of someone acting like they know us defies our basic human need of wanting to be truly known and  even deeper  to be known and loved. the superficiality of today is leaving a relational void in so many people’s lives..i believe it is best to be authentic in every aspect of your life. brené brown talks about this in her famous ted talk about the power of vulnerability. the people she studied who seemed to have a strong sense of love and belonging shared these three things:.courage.compassion.authenticity.in her words  “these folks had the courage to be imperfect. they had a connection as a result of authenticity. they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they are.”.what you see is what you get when you connect with louie: no pretenses  no games—just the real deal. he expects that in return from the humans he comes in contact with  and he is confused when he senses otherwise. thanks to louie  i have learned to let go of who i thought i should be in order to be who i really am..*********************.louie had to say goodbye to his lifelong buddy  sampson  this weekend. sammy was a great pal to louie and was the real deal. we will always remember the fun walks and visits we had with him. louie will miss seeing and playing with him  as will everyone in our neighborhood. run and jump  little sampson. you’re bound by nothing that will ever hold you back from being the fun-loving pup you were created to be..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  forgiveness  fundamentals in leadership  honesty  leadership  respect  servant leadership  transparency  trust  truth tags #creatingrelationships  #danisedistasi  #empoweringyourteam  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  #selfawareness  danise distasi  trust leave a comment.louie and mercy.april 6  2017 april 6  2017 by danisedistasi.this is actually a picture of mercy. as cute as she is  she’s not the subject of this blog  though she will be the subject of one soon. no  this blog is about my little louie and the mercy i’ve had to grant him over and over..louie is certainly a transformed dog since i rescued him three years ago. most of his bad behaviors are behind us  but he has one persistent habit that just drives me crazy. i have two videos of him owning up to it. apparently  it’s a habit he’s unwilling to change..louie gets into my laundry basket  very neatly removes one item of clothing  drags it onto the floor  and proceeds to roll around on it. we wrote a blog about it a couple of months ago. and this behavior has been evident from day one..no matter how many times i point to the clothes on the floor after each episode and sternly say no  he continues to do it. i’ve walked into the room with him happily trotting behind me  and as soon as i see the clothes and turn to look at him  he’ll drop to the floor and roll over on his back. i don’t have to say a word. he knows he’s guilty  yet he persists..last week while i was shopping at kroger  i ran into our dog trainer  zig  and expressed my frustration about this habit of lou’s. i explained that he has done well in other arenas  but this just drives me nuts..zig paused before saying  “some things are not going to change. sometimes it is just too much for him to ignore. the laundry basket is just too much for louie to resist.” i had to admit zig was right. louie was never going to change this behavior..i continued my grocery shopping and thought about zig’s wisdom. there was something deeper to this whole laundry basket thing. was zig implying that it was my fault that louie got into the basket?

according to merriam-webster’s definition  it is an awareness of one’s own personality or individuality. to this definition  i would add “flaws and all!” few leaders practice self-awareness because there is a mindset that says  “don’t be too introspective; keep moving ahead; don’t be too concerned about what other’s think of you.”.there is some validity in that advice  but as in everything  we need to balance that information. here are a few characteristics of relational leaders who are self-aware:.they know themselves well..they are always seeking and welcome feedback. they are not quick to make excuses or justifications when honest feedback is given..they are aware of the traits that hold them back  and take action to address them..they are conscious of their weaknesses and look to hire people who perform well in the areas where they lack expertise..they are natural delegators..they read people well (louie does this also. maybe he is more self-aware than i give him credit for)..self-awareness is key to our emotional health and the relational health of our team. it is actually freeing when you recognize the areas that are holding you back and release them so that others can step up to the plate and excel in their strengths..ask others to assist you in becoming more self-aware. the growth potential for not only you as a leader but for your team as well is astonishing and rewarding by way of a healthy culture and employee engagement..for now  i am still impressed with louie’s awareness of his environment. his self-awareness probably extends to his level of insecurities and fears only…but it’s a start!.monday  march 20  2017  is louie’s 5th birthday. my granddaughters decided his birthday should always be on the first day of spring because he is so full of life! send him an email to wish him a happy birthday louie@di-advisors.com..please click here to sign up for louie’s leadership lessons blog..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  fundamentals in leadership  healthy culture  honesty  leadership  the louie model  the paws model  transparency  trust  uncategorized tags #creatingrelationships  #developinggoals  #empoweringyourteam  #resolvingconflictpaws  #selfawareness  #simpleleadershipmodel leave a comment.bad behavior is contagious!.february 27  2017 february 28  2017 by danisedistasi.with the recent beautiful weather  louie and i have been taking long walks and enjoying our time together. louie is a pretty happy pup lately and trots down the street with a prance that matches his joyful heart..but then there’s this girl. you see  she’s absolutely beautiful with striking white fur and pale-blue eyes lined in black. she’s a tall  slim husky/shepherd mix  and louie is not quite sure what to think of her. apparently  she is also confused about him when they pass on the street..you lookin’ at me?.in his usual tough guy style  he gives her a look that says  “are you lookin’ at me? uh  you lookin’ at me?”.she then stands a little taller and looks down at him as if to say  “what are you talking about? you’re lookin’ at me!” he puffs his chest out and she pushes her nose at him  and before you know it they are huffing and puffing and challenging one another. with a slight tug on his leash and my usual command to “leave it ” we continue on our walk..now these two have had great interactions before  and  based on louie’s body language and tone of voice  he’s not aggressively challenging her. but i find it interesting that his bad behavior provokes her bad behavior and  if allowed  it may escalate to a more serious challenge..i noticed this too with his little buddy  mac. louie typically ignores him  but when mac is unusually “active ” louie seems to chime right in and become an obnoxious pup by playing rough (with me  not another dog) or ignoring me when it is time to settle down..our work teams are very similar. although a smile or a word of affirmation from a coworker can spread good cheer in the workplace  bad behavior and rudeness are also contagious. being rude or impolite to your coworkers can lead them to behave the same way  negatively affecting our culture and productivity..as leaders  rudeness should not be tolerated in our work or homes. while there may be many reasons for someone to be in a bad mood and react negatively  it is our responsibility as leaders to demonstrate that even under unpleasant circumstances it is never okay to be rude and disrespectful. so what are we to do?.it seems the “leave it” command works well for louie  and it works well for me  too. “leave it” doesn’t mean to ignore the situation and hope it goes away. it simply means to not dwell on it and let the emotion subside. oswald chambers  an early twentieth-century scottish theologian and teacher  said over a century ago  “there is always at least one more fact  which we know nothing about  in every person’s situation.”.this is a good time to revisit the paws method. when someone is rude and your first inclination is to become upset and respond rudely  try this method to help you analyze the situation before doing something you may regret:.pause—breathe! allow oxygen to get to your brain. you may need to walk away for a bit and then revisit the situation. there is power in the pause. when we pause before speaking  we gain time to process our thoughts..ask questions: “what’s going on?” “can you tell me more?” “can you help me understand?” “is everything okay?” ask yourself these things: is there something else going on in this person’s life? what’s going on with me? why does this aggravate me? reflect on your answers before you speak..wisdom: choose your words wisely. i would much rather have people feel uncomfortable waiting for me to find the right words than allowing myself to get sucked into poor behavior. carefully consider the words you are about to say. if they are not life-giving  do not say them. nothing good comes from useless  mindless words..seek to understand: once you pause  ask questions  and choose your words wisely  you will naturally seek to understand. remember  everyone has “stuff” in his or her backgrounds. and so do you!.there is no reason to tolerate rudeness in our workplace  and studies have shown that bad behavior begets bad behavior. we have a responsibility as leaders to stop that behavior in order to maintain or restore a healthy culture..as for louie and his beautiful tall cool blonde friend  i think they may secretly like each other. i may have to help him a bit with showing girls his interest. so far he’s not scoring any points  but i still love him..my bad little dog  talented as he may be. he actually pulled a towel out of the laundry basket and somehow wrapped himself in it and settled in for a nap!.click here to sign up for louie’s emails.through lessons learned from a well-loved rescue pup  a leadership model emerges that makes the connection to relationships  revealing the small ways leaders can empower their teams every day..click the image for information on how to order louie’s leadership lessons.louie’s leadership lessons are lovingly fed by….categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  ending well  fear and pride  forgiveness  fundamentals in leadership  gossip  healthy culture  honesty  leadership  relationships  respect  the louie model  transparency  trust  truth tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  distasi advisors  healthy cultures  healthy relationships  love  realational leadership leave a comment.will you please stop whining.february 6  2017 february 7  2017 by danisedistasi.a passing thought drifted through my mind the other day: i will miss all the love and attention i have received over the past few weeks. but since i would rather hear “wow  you’re doing so well” than “oh  gee  sorry you’re still struggling with your recovery ” the thought passed quickly  never to return..because i’m ready to close the chapter on my accident and subsequent surgery  my passing thought is not what the subject line is referring to. this is a blog about my persnickety pup louie and his ever-increasing need to whine. while i know he suffered trauma over the past couple of months along with me  his whining seems to have increased exponentially rather than to have subsided as i would have expected. i soon discovered his behavior has nothing to do with my injury. instead  louie is reacting to a new dog in the neighborhood..this new dog represents everything louie hates. the dog is a male  he’s bigger than lou  and he’s . . . shhhh . . . not neutered. the last issue sends louie into a tizzy even before we walk out the door. his hackles go up  and he puffs out his chest and huffs as he walks out. but then the incessant whining begins. and once he starts that  it’s tough to get him to stop..one morning as we exited the garage  we made a sharp left turn out of our driveway and hurried away from where the dog lives as quickly as a girl with a cane can manage. louie looked back  whined  and seemed disoriented. i tugged on his collar and gave a stern command  “leave it ” which he immediately obeyed  but his memory is keen  and it quickly took him back to the dark side. i was hoping he would find a new smell to distract him..thanks to zig our dog trainer  i learned a long time ago that louie whines out of fear  so i have to step up and walk with confidence. that’s tough to do considering i’m still healing  but i did the best i could. louie suspiciously eyed the cane  and then looked back at me with a face that said he was not convinced i could protect us both . . . and i didn’t blame him..as our walk settled into a more relaxed pace  i reflected on why some people  like louie  seem to whine so much. do you have a few whiners on your team? it’s easy to get frustrated and dismiss them  but there is usually something deeper going on that we may never uncover unless we take the time to do so..fear is a big issue for louie  which is why he whines. fear is a big issue for people as well and could be the reason some folks whine. i have learned to counter louie’s fear  not with my confidence but with love. love is the first step of the louie leadership model:.love is foundational to building trust and integrity for a personal or professional relationship to flourish. without love and trust  our relationships are like fragile shells that have nothing inside of them and with the slightest amount of pressure  are easily shattered. because of the love i have demonstrated for louie on a regular basis  he has learned to trust me. [for more on leading with trust  see this article by my friend  randy conley  vice president of client services & trust practice leader for the ken blanchard companies.].a teammate may whine because the team is experiencing a daunting and uncomfortable change. loving people through such change does not mean we coddle them. it means we shed light on the situation  we share the truth  and we press through together..love is more impactful than complaining to others that someone is a whiner..our society tends to misuse the word love. in fact  very few understand the strength and character it takes to love others. we have fluffy commercials about it  emoticons  and facebook posts. martin luther king  jr. said  “darkness cannot drive out darkness  only light can do that. hate cannot drive out hate  only love can do that.”.and who can argue with this verse: “such love has no fear because perfect love expels all fear. if we are afraid  it is for fear of punishment  and this shows that we have not fully experienced his (god’s) perfect love.”.i doubt louie will be able to love the new dog in the neighborhood anytime soon. in fact  i’m sure he is hoping the dog moves away. in the meantime  i’m working on loving lou through this ordeal and rebuilding his confidence and trust in me so he knows i will never allow another dog to threaten him..but louie is a dog and as humans  we can choose to love. you can be the change agent for someone by removing fear of punishment or detrimental consequences and instilling love instead. such love is the gateway to experiencing god’s perfect love and the cornerstone on which excellent and effective leadership is built..note: my friend t.d. hughes knows how emphatic i am about leadership and love and recently sent me an article i

that means!.january 24  2017 january 24  2017 by danisedistasi.our last blog detailed a journey i’m glad to say i am more than halfway through. if all goes well  my release date from all restrictions is february 1  2017. i am off all pain medication  and i took my first solo drive yesterday. i am beginning to see some normalcy slowly trickle back into my life. again  i am completely humbled by the continued outpouring of love and encouragement. thank you!.and then  there’s louie! louie was as traumatized as i was through this journey. he had to adjust to my being gone for two weeks; friends coming and going  walking and feeding him  playing with him  all while he constantly watched the door with the hope i would walk through it any minute..now that i’m home and he’s learned to trust my erratic movements with a cane  he seems to have settled back into some interesting habits: growling at people who come to my door (even his dog walkers) and jumping on the couch to sit directly across from me (better to watch me  he says)..one evening  a friend came by to take louie for a walk. after they finished and she came in to sit with me for awhile  he ran into the house  checked on me  and then ran upstairs  where he ran the length of the hallway several times. then  i heard a big commotion  and from where i was sitting  i could tell what that little rascal was doing. he was getting into my clothesbasket in my bathroom and taking all the clothes out of it  having no consideration whatsoever for the amount of time it took me to get the clothes into that basket..his continued motion  which was evident even though he was a floor above me  indicated he not only removed the items from the basket  he was also rolling in them—all of them! some time ago  i explained to zig  our trainer  louie’s annoying bad habit of rolling in the dirty laundry. i assumed it was because he wanted to surround himself with my smell  weird as that is..but zig assured me that was not it at all. louie was getting his smell on my clothes  showing his dominance over me. what? now that is a really annoying bad habit that makes me realize we are back to square one. there will be no dominance of louie over me..but this is not surprising. when it takes all my energy to walk from the living room to the kitchen  disciplining a dog is not high on my list  especially since we’ve been through this before. the pressure was off of louie to behave well  and when the pressure is off  he reverts back to his old habits..that is so like us. a while ago  i wrote a blog about something i learned from my time with the ken blanchard companies about the dynamics of change. one dynamic is that when the pressure is off  we revert to our original behaviors. well  the pressure was definitely off  and louie was back to some of his old habits. we will need to spend time correcting that. but rather than lament  i reflected on what this means as far as my recent journey and getting “back to normal.”.finally being able to drive did give me a sense of life getting back to normal. getting off medication  walking better  and looking forward to some normalcy were great goals for recovery. but did i really want normalcy to be my goal?.not this time  not this year. i am going to be intentional (keeping the pressure on) about breaking past the norm to live a well-meaning life by doing the following:.pruning activities  objects  and even some relationships  all to devote precious time to what matters;.being kind in thought  word  and deed  whether people deserve it or not. i don’t mean just merely being nice (and sometimes superficial and phony)  but being authentic and loving—speaking truth in love and showing those who differ from me  or have differing viewpoints  the compassion that only comes from faith in god;.taking time to listen in order to learn—and not rushing to the next project;.being still and having plenty of margin in my life;.laughing more; and.dancing (okay  that one is normal for me  but now takes on an even more special meaning). i will take time to dance more with my grandchildren and even my adult daughter because that’s what distasi kids do. my niece sara is getting married in september  and she has promised we will dance the night away. that is my goal for 2017..be intentional about breaking past the norm. life is too short and too easily interrupted for us to stay stuck in the status quo. and you are never too old to take that first step to crashing through the “same ol’  same ol’.”.as for louie  we have some work to do. as i have been writing  he slipped into my laundry room and pulled out a dishtowel. he is so bad. i know he has a large fan base of people who love him  but this annoying little habit just makes me shake my head. i suppose being intentionally kind starts now with little louie distasi!.click the cover to order louie’s leadership legacy book..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble

danisedistasi.today was the first day i was able to wrap my arms around louie and give him a huge bear hug. it was three weeks ago that i had an accident and our lives quickly changed. and in celebrating my ability to hug him and receive an under the neck snuggle from him  i thought it fitting to resume our blog after an unintentionally extended vacation..december 18  2016  was filled with great anticipation. it was one week before christmas  and the distasi family was planning to gather at my house to celebrate christmas. everything was set; the massive amounts of food  the decorations  gifts  and music. it was to be a celebration to top all the ones we had celebrated so far as a family..louie and i took our usual stroll early that morning. two days before  there had been a late evening ice storm  but this particular morning seemed okay as far as icy pavement was concerned. still  i was cautious and walked in the grass as much as possible..an elderly neighbor has a very long driveway  and louie and i had been taking her daily newspaper to her so she would not have to venture out and lean over to pick it up. as soon as i stepped on the driveway  my feet flew up in the air  and i landed on my left hip. i lost control of louie  and it took me a few moments to catch my breath. i couldn’t see louie  and panic was about to set in. his normal reaction when something startles him is to run away. and seeing his mama flying through the air had to have been startling..i forced myself to turn as far to the left as i could. there louie sat  close behind my left shoulder. i reached around to draw him close to me. as he tucked his head under my arm  i felt his shaking and heard him whimper. to hear him cry broke my heart  and my tears started to flow uncontrollably. i knew i could not move—and whatever would take place from that moment forward  it would be a long journey. louie chose to stay by me as the faithful friend that he is..a neighbor pulled up with his phone in hand  already calling 911  and i called my friend and neighbor cindy to pick up louie. i called my daughter  marisa  and the network of community  family  and friends jumped into action. everyone’s life was interrupted on december 18  2016..after a jarring ambulance ride  surgery to repair a femur that was fractured in two places  a total hip replacement  five days in the hospital  and physical therapy  i was released to marisa and matt’s home for respite care and to celebrate christmas with the two cutest nurses on the face of the earth. louie had been well taken care of by my wonderful neighbors who had walked him  let him stay in their homes  taken him to daycare to play  and given him more love than he could imagine..life interrupted has taught louie and me a few things:.we appreciate life and the little things: although that seems so cliché  it was the small steps of accomplishment that filled me with joy. every day  i set new goals to accomplish—goals i never would have dreamed to set before. for instance  i learned to get out of bed  to go to the bathroom  and to take my meds without having to wake my daughter to help me. and to carry a cup of coffee in the morning to enjoy my quiet time. mea and evi helped me do things as they watched me improve. christmas had a deeper meaning this year with sincere thankfulness  love  and joy!.you really do know who your friends are: so many people dropped everything to help. it was a terrible strain on marisa and matt as they took care of me. so many friends offered to grocery shop  run errands  and stay with me when i finally came home. my sisters and cousin packed their clothes and took turns staying overnight. my brothers were calling  visiting  and bringing food. the neighbors who took care of louie were such godsends. many people could not help because of logistics  but they checked in and prayed..you have to move out of your comfort zone: this was a tough one for louie and me. i had to let people help me. what a humbling position to be in; i was helpless. i have never stayed in a hospital other than to give birth. i don’t take any medicines  and i have never fractured a single bone. the outpouring of love and encouragement has been overwhelming. louie had to be comfortable with people coming and going in and out of our home and driving him to and from daycare. but we both pressed on through pain  frustration  fear  and being uncomfortable. it was difficult  but i believe we made it past the hardest part of this process. there’s still much more healing to take place and there will always be a next move out of our comfort zone. i have no doubt we’ll press through that too..some things just do not matter: the superficiality of the holidays clashed with the richness of genuine  loving relationships. there can be no comparison of the things that are bought with the things that are sought  caught  and taught. the characteristics of love  joy  and peace are important for us to live and pass on to others. it takes effort  but it is worth the time and effort. i am a better person because of the love  joy  and peace that others shared with me this season..2017 is going to be a great year of love and strength. louie is a better dog because he chose faithfulness over running away. he trusted and allowed others into his world to help us! we are closer because of these last few weeks. thank you to so many for being in my life and for your prayers and support!.click here to sign up for louie’s email list..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and

expectancy.december 12  2016 december 13  2016 by danisedistasi.louie  my adopted pup  and i were walking on a beautiful fall day when we saw one of his pug buddies—or so we thought. his friend sammy is a tan and black pug with a unique characteristic: his tongue protrudes ever so slightly. i recognized that the person walking him was not his owner. that’s not unusual since many of us in the community need others to walk our dogs on occasion. louie was excited to see his buddy and could hardly wait to romp and play..as we approached  i asked if the dog was sammy  because he had the same markings and same characteristic of a slightly protruding tongue. the person walking him said no. but louie quickly ran up to the sammy look-alike; it did not take him long to realize this was not his buddy  and then he became indignant as if he was mad at the pug for not being sammy..we quickly said our good-byes while louie kicked up his feet and snarled just to make sure the dog understood he was not even close to being sammy..i realized louie’s expectations for playing with his friend were unmet  and disappointment had set in quickly. based on all appearances  louie was expecting to have fun and play  but that expectation was not to be filled that day..this time of year  the majority of us have many expectations that  when unmet for whatever reason  will disappoint us. people have a hard time moving on from such setbacks. i think these disappointments occur because we’ve set ourselves up for failure when we box up our expectations in the hopes that they will be fulfilled..instead  what if we had a spirit of expectancy? you may wonder what the difference is between having expectations and having a spirit of expectancy. a spirit of expectancy is what very young children usually possess. they have the mindset that something wonderful is about to happen  but with no expectation of specifics. while they may wish for something on their christmas list  it is their heart of expectancy that is truly magical. it is the hopefulness of something wonderful. for me  that may entail time with my family  but without expectation that the time meets any specific criteria—it is simply time together..another example occurred on the holiest of nights. for centuries  people expected the messiah to come amongst their midst. in this expectation  they envisioned a king  surrounded by throngs of noble men and women and trumpets blaring. because of these expectations they missed the wonder of all that took place on that quiet  serene night when the stars were brightly shining..yet only those with a spirit of expectancy  whose hearts were open to the wonder of what only the creator of the universe could put into action  witnessed the birth of the king in a simple  lowly manger..expectations for particular things and events always run the risk of disappointing us  since many times  events and what others do are out of our control. as we wind down our year  rather than focusing on the disappointments of unmet expectations  let’s look forward with a heart of expectancy and see if that doesn’t lighten our spirits with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen..while louie experienced disappointment by not having his expectations met with the look-alike sammy  it did not dampen his spirit of expectancy. he still walks out of our home with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen. something as simple as seeing a dear neighbor who pats him on the head or gives him belly rubs lends to his heart of wonder..click the image for

november 29  2016 by danisedistasi.the subject line might offend louie. in fact  it might offend you as well. but let’s face it—in the heat of the recent political battle  many of us are shaking our heads while trying to understand what just happened. one thing i do know is that disrespect for people with differing opinions is at an all-time high..the rude rhetoric on all sides of the political spectrum gave me pause and made me think of louie and some of his not-so-friendly foes. i am convinced that if people were to act the way our pets do  we would all get along better. for example  sometimes louie might see a dog that challenges him. the two will snarl and growl and perhaps even bark at each other. however  the minute we walk side by side with the dog and its owner  they seem to get along. there is something about being intentional and walking alongside someone you have a disagreement with..louie has done this with my niece’s dog  buddy. those two little boys will scrunch their noses  curl their lips  show their teeth  stand their hair up  and bark in such a high pitch that people turn their heads with a look of concern. andrea laughs  assuring everyone in sight that the dogs are actually cousins and are fine with each other. it sure doesn’t seem like it when they are facing one another. however  as soon as we start walking  they are fine together..louie also behaves this way with rambunctious claire  his other cousin noli  his neighbor snickers  and a new boxer in the community named socks. what is it about being side by side with their supposed nemesis? i think there are several things:.it is less threatening..they are on equal ground..they see the same vision of what lies ahead..they walk with the same pace..it is easier to carry the other’s burden. (okay  this one relates to humans  not louie.).what if some of our leaders were intentional about walking side by side instead of duking it out? i am reminded of an article i wrote in 2005 when i worked with ken blanchard titled “leading with your heart takes humility.” although it was written over eleven years ago  the premise holds true today: humility is the key to excelling in leadership. and servant leaders are humble enough to walk beside someone they disagree with..i won’t share the full article here (you can find it at this link)  but here are some of the highlights:.something is glaringly missing from leadership today. sadly  many leadership programs are missing just one key ingredient: the heart. not just the heart of the issue or the heart of the matter—the heart of the people..what gets in your way? what truly is your motive for being a leader or wanting to lead others? is it for selfish gain or to better others?.many times  our ego gets in the way and what bubbles up out of our hearts are things like pride  selfishness  and even fear..how can you push past what holds you back? in getting past the barriers  is the challenge as a leader to balance confidence with humility to fight ego issues? ken blanchard often uses the quote  “humility is not thinking less of yourself. it’s thinking of yourself less.” every time you make a leadership decision  are you thinking of yourself or others?.confidence does not come from being in a dominant position and leading by intimidation. doing this will cause you to lose respect from others  and any talk about values or integrity will be ignored. humility  however  is not something they teach us in business schools. it is a character trait that is honed over time with truth and love..our businesses  organizations  and families are hungry for leadership coupled with humility. it takes commitment to make the necessary changes to have a healthy culture and humble leaders..perhaps our world could learn a lesson from louie about being intentional and walking side by side with others rather than snarling at them. while louie doesn’t understand humility  his actions speak louder than his woof. he is more than willing to walk alongside others. as i watch his actions  i am convinced that we humans have much to learn from our dogs..louie’s newest revision is now available. click on the book to order..click here to sign up for louie’s email distribution!.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  conflict  consistency  courage  fear and pride  forgiveness  fundamentals in leadership  gossip  healthy culture  honesty  ken blanchard  leadership  moral compromise  relationships  respect  servant leadership  trust  truth tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  #pridegetsintheway  #toughlessons  danise distasi  distasi advisors  healthy cultures  healthy relationships  louie's leadership lessons  realational leadership 2 comments.you can’t make me something i don’t want to be!.november 13  2016 november 15  2016 by danisedistasi.louie was not having it. he planted all four paws on the floor and would not move an inch. his face let me know he was not pleased. at all..“louie ” i said sternly as i tried to squeeze his 40 pounds of muscle where it didn’t want to go. “this is only for two hours  if that. surely you can oblige me.”.i sat back and stared at him  exasperated. for the last few halloweens  i’ve donned a cruella de vil look and spent the evening with my grandchildren. this year i thought it would be fun to take louie along in a dalmatian outfit. except there were no dalmatian costumes for dogs. the closest thing i could find was a child’s costume for a spotted cow..i had imagined how it would turn out. louie might not share my enthusiasm for this creative costume. but he’d forget all about it when he set eyes on my granddaughters  evi and mea. he’d jump out of the car and happily trot with them along the street  greeting other children  trying to get a peek into their candy loot. i just knew louie would have more fun than he could imagine if he could just push through wearing a silly cow outfit and look as much like a dalmatian as he could..i also imagined it would make a great blog lesson: all about pressing through uncomfortable situations to enjoy the outcome. sounds good  right?.being someone we’re not.but none of that happened. yes  lou was happy to see evi and mea. he did enjoy it when other children came up to love on him. but he hated his costume and was mad at me the entire time. he wouldn’t even pose for a picture  and believe me  that’s not like him..i finally took the costume off and let him be louie..too often we find ourselves being something we don’t want to be. maybe it’s of our own doing — because we think we need to fit in  and it requires being someone “different.” but often it’s because someone else expects us to be different than what we are..maybe it’s a negative thing: a boss requires us to be something based on their own insecurities. or maybe it’s positive: a leader sees potential in us that we don’t see or can even imagine  and they want to coach us to be better..no matter the reason  we resist because it is uncomfortable to be something we are not. we don’t want to don a costume and fake it..can’t make anyone change.it’s tough to balance being authentic and at the same time develop beyond mediocrity toward excellence. it can feel like donning a facade and “faking it till we make it.” what should leaders do to help folks grow?.if you’re in a position of leadership  you can suggest someone continue to develop. you can provide tools  mentoring  and ongoing training. but you can’t make them be something they don’t want to be. each person is responsible for taking that first step to wanting to make significant changes in their lives..still  there are ways to influence those in whom you see potential. for example:.watch to see whether the person shows an eagerness to learn and grow  i.e.  reading books and asking for help..ask them where do they see themselves going? what is their end goal?.share with them what potential you see in them..be sure your expectations align with their skillset and desires..if their end goal and desires outweigh their skillset  place them on a realistic development plan and be clear about expectations..greater than they imagine.when louie and i arrived back home  he was one tired pup. he slinked upstairs to his little bed to lay down. his expression told me he was still traumatized by the costume. but as i knelt down to give him a kiss  i looked into his eyes and saw a little spark..it was a look that said  “if you are trying to make me be something different than who i am  at least make me a lion!”.and with that  he tucked his head into the fold of his front paw and fell fast asleep. no doubt  that evening he dreamt of being a lion..louie the lion…hear me roar!.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  fundamentals in leadership  healthy culture  honesty  leadership  moral compromise  people process differently  relationships  respect  the louie model  the paws model  transparency  trust  unmet expectations tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  #louiesleadershiplessons  healthy relationships  hope love  leadership  trust leave a comment.post navigation.older posts.newer posts.← previous 1 2 3 4 5 next →.subscribe to blog via email.enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email..email address	.search for:.recent posts.time to say goodbye may 22  2020.when the world was silent may 14  2020.back to normal?

2017 by danisedistasi.today was the first day i was able to wrap my arms around louie and give him a huge bear hug. it was three weeks ago that i had an accident and our lives quickly changed. and in celebrating my ability to hug him and receive an under the neck snuggle from him  i thought it fitting to resume our blog after an unintentionally extended vacation..december 18  2016  was filled with great anticipation. it was one week before christmas  and the distasi family was planning to gather at my house to celebrate christmas. everything was set; the massive amounts of food  the decorations  gifts  and music. it was to be a celebration to top all the ones we had celebrated so far as a family..louie and i took our usual stroll early that morning. two days before  there had been a late evening ice storm  but this particular morning seemed okay as far as icy pavement was concerned. still  i was cautious and walked in the grass as much as possible..an elderly neighbor has a very long driveway  and louie and i had been taking her daily newspaper to her so she would not have to venture out and lean over to pick it up. as soon as i stepped on the driveway  my feet flew up in the air  and i landed on my left hip. i lost control of louie  and it took me a few moments to catch my breath. i couldn’t see louie  and panic was about to set in. his normal reaction when something startles him is to run away. and seeing his mama flying through the air had to have been startling..i forced myself to turn as far to the left as i could. there louie sat  close behind my left shoulder. i reached around to draw him close to me. as he tucked his head under my arm  i felt his shaking and heard him whimper. to hear him cry broke my heart  and my tears started to flow uncontrollably. i knew i could not move—and whatever would take place from that moment forward  it would be a long journey. louie chose to stay by me as the faithful friend that he is..a neighbor pulled up with his phone in hand  already calling 911  and i called my friend and neighbor cindy to pick up louie. i called my daughter  marisa  and the network of community  family  and friends jumped into action. everyone’s life was interrupted on december 18  2016..after a jarring ambulance ride  surgery to repair a femur that was fractured in two places  a total hip replacement  five days in the hospital  and physical therapy  i was released to marisa and matt’s home for respite care and to celebrate christmas with the two cutest nurses on the face of the earth. louie had been well taken care of by my wonderful neighbors who had walked him  let him stay in their homes  taken him to daycare to play  and given him more love than he could imagine..life interrupted has taught louie and me a few things:.we appreciate life and the little things: although that seems so cliché  it was the small steps of accomplishment that filled me with joy. every day  i set new goals to accomplish—goals i never would have dreamed to set before. for instance  i learned to get out of bed  to go to the bathroom  and to take my meds without having to wake my daughter to help me. and to carry a cup of coffee in the morning to enjoy my quiet time. mea and evi helped me do things as they watched me improve. christmas had a deeper meaning this year with sincere thankfulness  love  and joy!.you really do know who your friends are: so many people dropped everything to help. it was a terrible strain on marisa and matt as they took care of me. so many friends offered to grocery shop  run errands  and stay with me when i finally came home. my sisters and cousin packed their clothes and took turns staying overnight. my brothers were calling  visiting  and bringing food. the neighbors who took care of louie were such godsends. many people could not help because of logistics  but they checked in and prayed..you have to move out of your comfort zone: this was a tough one for louie and me. i had to let people help me. what a humbling position to be in; i was helpless. i have never stayed in a hospital other than to give birth. i don’t take any medicines  and i have never fractured a single bone. the outpouring of love and encouragement has been overwhelming. louie had to be comfortable with people coming and going in and out of our home and driving him to and from daycare. but we both pressed on through pain  frustration  fear  and being uncomfortable. it was difficult  but i believe we made it past the hardest part of this process. there’s still much more healing to take place and there will always be a next move out of our comfort zone. i have no doubt we’ll press through that too..some things just do not matter: the superficiality of the holidays clashed with the richness of genuine  loving relationships. there can be no comparison of the things that are bought with the things that are sought  caught  and taught. the characteristics of love  joy  and peace are important for us to live and pass on to others. it takes effort  but it is worth the time and effort. i am a better person because of the love  joy  and peace that others shared with me this season..2017 is going to be a great year of love and strength. louie is a better dog because he chose faithfulness over running away. he trusted and allowed others into his world to help us! we are closer because of these last few weeks. thank you to so many for being in my life and for your prayers and support!.click here to sign up for louie’s email list..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and

expectancy.december 12  2016 december 13  2016 by danisedistasi.louie  my adopted pup  and i were walking on a beautiful fall day when we saw one of his pug buddies—or so we thought. his friend sammy is a tan and black pug with a unique characteristic: his tongue protrudes ever so slightly. i recognized that the person walking him was not his owner. that’s not unusual since many of us in the community need others to walk our dogs on occasion. louie was excited to see his buddy and could hardly wait to romp and play..as we approached  i asked if the dog was sammy  because he had the same markings and same characteristic of a slightly protruding tongue. the person walking him said no. but louie quickly ran up to the sammy look-alike; it did not take him long to realize this was not his buddy  and then he became indignant as if he was mad at the pug for not being sammy..we quickly said our good-byes while louie kicked up his feet and snarled just to make sure the dog understood he was not even close to being sammy..i realized louie’s expectations for playing with his friend were unmet  and disappointment had set in quickly. based on all appearances  louie was expecting to have fun and play  but that expectation was not to be filled that day..this time of year  the majority of us have many expectations that  when unmet for whatever reason  will disappoint us. people have a hard time moving on from such setbacks. i think these disappointments occur because we’ve set ourselves up for failure when we box up our expectations in the hopes that they will be fulfilled..instead  what if we had a spirit of expectancy? you may wonder what the difference is between having expectations and having a spirit of expectancy. a spirit of expectancy is what very young children usually possess. they have the mindset that something wonderful is about to happen  but with no expectation of specifics. while they may wish for something on their christmas list  it is their heart of expectancy that is truly magical. it is the hopefulness of something wonderful. for me  that may entail time with my family  but without expectation that the time meets any specific criteria—it is simply time together..another example occurred on the holiest of nights. for centuries  people expected the messiah to come amongst their midst. in this expectation  they envisioned a king  surrounded by throngs of noble men and women and trumpets blaring. because of these expectations they missed the wonder of all that took place on that quiet  serene night when the stars were brightly shining..yet only those with a spirit of expectancy  whose hearts were open to the wonder of what only the creator of the universe could put into action  witnessed the birth of the king in a simple  lowly manger..expectations for particular things and events always run the risk of disappointing us  since many times  events and what others do are out of our control. as we wind down our year  rather than focusing on the disappointments of unmet expectations  let’s look forward with a heart of expectancy and see if that doesn’t lighten our spirits with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen..while louie experienced disappointment by not having his expectations met with the look-alike sammy  it did not dampen his spirit of expectancy. he still walks out of our home with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen. something as simple as seeing a dear neighbor who pats him on the head or gives him belly rubs lends to his heart of wonder..click the image for

november 29  2016 by danisedistasi.the subject line might offend louie. in fact  it might offend you as well. but let’s face it—in the heat of the recent political battle  many of us are shaking our heads while trying to understand what just happened. one thing i do know is that disrespect for people with differing opinions is at an all-time high..the rude rhetoric on all sides of the political spectrum gave me pause and made me think of louie and some of his not-so-friendly foes. i am convinced that if people were to act the way our pets do  we would all get along better. for example  sometimes louie might see a dog that challenges him. the two will snarl and growl and perhaps even bark at each other. however  the minute we walk side by side with the dog and its owner  they seem to get along. there is something about being intentional and walking alongside someone you have a disagreement with..louie has done this with my niece’s dog  buddy. those two little boys will scrunch their noses  curl their lips  show their teeth  stand their hair up  and bark in such a high pitch that people turn their heads with a look of concern. andrea laughs  assuring everyone in sight that the dogs are actually cousins and are fine with each other. it sure doesn’t seem like it when they are facing one another. however  as soon as we start walking  they are fine together..louie also behaves this way with rambunctious claire  his other cousin noli  his neighbor snickers  and a new boxer in the community named socks. what is it about being side by side with their supposed nemesis? i think there are several things:.it is less threatening..they are on equal ground..they see the same vision of what lies ahead..they walk with the same pace..it is easier to carry the other’s burden. (okay  this one relates to humans  not louie.).what if some of our leaders were intentional about walking side by side instead of duking it out? i am reminded of an article i wrote in 2005 when i

you enjoyed your summer. in celebration of the 3rd anniversary of louie’s adoption  we decided to to do an extended blog  introducing our louie leadership model..our story began three years ago in the rolling hills of boyd county  kentucky—a place i never knew existed. it’s your typical love story: boy meets girl  boy woos girl with his charming ways and big brown eyes  girl is swept off her feet  and they fall in love and live happily ever after. except in this story  the boy is an adopted puppy named louie..although i have a tremendous amount of leadership experience  i never truly understood leadership until i met this little guy..our blog  and my soon-to-be-released third book  louie’s leadership lessons  are compilations of time-tested leadership models  heart-warming stories of courage and love  and techniques for overcoming common issues such as pride  fear  and doubt—all illustrated by eye-opening experiences with my rescue dog. the time i spent with him and his trainer was life changing..this extended blog is the introduction to our new book and contains nuggets of wisdom i’ve learned over the decades about leadership and the gift of relationships with a fresh perspective renewed by louie’s point of view..i have distilled all louie has taught me into a leadership model that is easy to remember and easy to follow. when you have a leadership dilemma  ask yourself  “what would louie do?” the answer is in his name: louie..love.louie was either lost or abandoned in kentucky and made his way to cincinnati  where i live  through a number of shelters. although i love dogs  i had decided not to get another one for many reasons—that is  until i just happened to stop by petsmart while they were conducting an adopt-a-pet weekend and encountered this abandoned mutt with big brown. i tossed my concerns aside  brought him home  and named him louie distasi. i soon discovered that louie had brought a lot of emotional baggage to the relationship. he demonstrated behaviors that deeply concerned me  and i engaged a dog trainer to help address them. i quickly realized i needed training as much as louie did  if not more so..i’m not afraid of tough lessons  and i’m always looking for ways to improve my leadership skills. but working with louie was challenging. the bottom line was that louie needed acceptance  consistency  discipline  and—above all—unconditional love. i wasn’t sure i was equipped to provide all that..when i first met louie  he was very sweet and subdued in his crate. several hours after we arrived home  he became much more active. i loved louie when he was a good little dog  but i didn’t love him so much when he started to act out and behaved badly when people came to the door  etc. it was a struggle  and i had to make a choice to love him. i decided to commit to loving this abandoned pup  in spite of his baggage..employees can be like louie. they bring a lot of baggage to the job and may be hard to love at times. one of the most critical needs for any human being is the need to feel loved. all of us have this innate desire  yet it is one of the most difficult to fulfill. c. s. lewis said it best:.“to be loved but not known is comforting but superficial. to be known and not loved is our greatest fear. but to be fully known and truly loved is  well  a lot like being loved by god. it is what we need more than anything. it liberates us from pretense  humbles us out of our self-righteousness  and fortifies us for any difficulty life can throw at us.”.love is not merely a warm fuzzy feeling; love in action is the aspect that is important in leadership. when i mention the word “love” in the workplace  i receive a tremendous amount of pushback. people say  “don’t bring it up; you’ll have hr issues.” i question whether people understand what love really means..while employees can be hard to love at times (maybe most of the time)  it is still your choice to love or be indifferent toward them. let’s look at the characteristics of leaders who love:.they are patient..they are kind..they honor other people..they are honest..they are protective..they are trustworthy..they are always hopeful..they persevere through difficult situations..they are other seeking and other serving..they manage their emotions well..of course  there are also things that they are not:.they aren’t envious..they aren’t boastful..they aren’t prideful..they don’t keep records of wrongs..the characteristics of loving leaders are those that leaders should display when they are working with their people—baggage and all. that’s what love in action looks like..servant leaders are those who display the characteristics above. they are humble enough to serve and strong enough to lead..objectives and goals.the next thing i learned in the course of training louie was that  as a leader  i needed clear objectives and plans for how to achieve them. this is true with our teams at work  as well. objectives must be clear and specific. they have to be trackable. they have to be relevant. they have to be attainable and motivating..i engaged a trainer who taught me that my first goal in this journey with louie was to establish my role as leader. yep—i actually had to learn how to be louie’s alpha. i wrongly assumed he would know i was in charge because i’m bigger than him  i own the house  i pay for the meals. assuming is a mistake many leaders make. throughout our blog  you’ll read the importance of objectives and goals with each lesson i learned through louie..understanding.another lesson i learned was to truly understand that louie had “stuff” in his background. fear and anxiety issues were at the top of the list. these may have come from abandonment or abuse—it’s hard to say. but it is not unlike everyone we meet  whether he or she is on our team  or just a person whose path we crossed in the grocery store. every human being needs to feel loved and valued. it is our innermost need  and it was this little dog’s need as well. he had never had a sense of being valued in his life  and he needed to know that someone cared about him. i had to understand louie’s struggles to love him  which would enable me to set clear objectives and goals for our journey together. i needed to understand louie’s issues. it wasn’t easy to get past some of them. they were real and profound..as leaders  we need to take the time to understand our people. we need to realize that there’s always something about a person’s circumstances that we don’t know  and before we judge people  we need to try to understand them..when you run into an issue with someone and your first inclination is to become upset  try the paws method to help you analyze the situation before doing something you may regret:.pause…breathe! allow oxygen to get to your brain..ask the person questions: “what’s going on?” “can you tell me more?” “help me understand.” “is everything ok?” ask yourself questions: “why does this aggravate me?”.use wisdom. choose your words wisely. i would much rather have people feel uncomfortable waiting for me to find the right words than i ever would with words that could be hurtful..seek to understand. once you pause  ask questions  and choose your words wisely  you will naturally seek to understand. remember  everyone has “stuff” in his or her backgrounds. and so do you!.as leaders  we need to make an effort to understand. take time to understand your people and avoid making assumptions. throughout this blog  there are many lessons relating to how i learned to understand louie  who could not verbally communicate with me. these lessons will help you understand how others communicate and process ideas differently than you do—and that’s ok..investment.i then learned to invest my time and talent into developing louie. we should ask ourselves  “how much time do we invest in our teams? our families? our friends?” take the time to get to know people and invest in them..this picture breaks my heart. this is louie the first night he came home with me. he curled up in the corner  scared and alone. i put a pillow next to him to provide some comfort. louie now sleeps in a very open bed in my bedroom because he feels safe with me  and i with him. i chose to invest a tremendous amount of time in louie so that he could learn to trust and love me. it took time. everything takes time. you cannot go wrong by investing your time getting to know people. take them out to lunch. ask them questions. this point relates back to understanding. it links to feeling valued  and it relates to feeling loved. take time to gather information. you never know what you can uncover when you give your time..there are many suggestions for  and examples of  investing in others throughout our blog. get to know people  spend time with them  share your talents and your skill set; put effort into your relationships with people because you want to give without receiving anything in return. i can guarantee that if you are a leader  and you do this  your team will be more productive  creative  and effective. it is the foundation for a healthy culture. invest your time..empowerment.the last step in my leadership training with louie was to empower him. empowering your team is essential  but it’s not simply letting people do whatever they want to do. empowering is taking the time to love them and establishing clear objectives and goals. it is understanding them  and investing in them. once you do these things  your people will be empowered to use their gifts and talents to do their jobs; and in doing so  you empower them to be the people god created them to be—not who you think they should be. they will be loved and valued..louie is an entirely different dog today because i love him. i took the time to set up a development plan and was clear about objectives and goals for him to be a good  healthy dog and for us to enjoy a relationship together. i had to understand his needs. i had to understand his background. i had to figure out what was going on with him. i invested time  my skill set  and other people’s skill sets to help develop him. he is empowered to be a fun-loving  free little dog..my work with louie is not unlike leading our teams. transformation occurs when we apply the louie leadership model: love  objectives  understanding  investment  and empowerment  as well as the paws model: pause  ask  wisdom  and seek. throughout louie’s leadership lessons  you will see more examples of these two models wrapped in stories of love  struggles  and immense joy..while it brings me great pleasure to know that louie is a transformed dog  i am the one who has been profoundly changed into a better leader because of the lessons i’ve learned from my experiences with him. we look forward to continuing our journey with you through our blog..sign up for louie’s mailing list..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  conflict

walk when we came upon two dogs we’ve never met before. one of them is a twin of louie. she is a corgi-beagle mix  and she even has the same facial markings as louie. she is a bit smaller than louie  and her name is peanut..there was a noticeable difference  however  in the size of their mouths. like her name  she was a peanut  and her mouth was tiny compared to louie’s very big mouth. louie’s mouth can do many things: bark  growl  show his teeth  eat  and mouth to pull and play. louie provides “love taps” by poking his mouth against your hand when he is excited to see you. his mouth is conveniently attached to his nose which he uses to poke and prod. they work together to borough in the ground and pull lumps of grass to get to a mole..although louie’s large mouth is actually harmless  he could do a lot of damage with it. this is not unlike ourselves. our mouths  specifically our tongues  may seem harmless  but oh the damage they can do and usually  unnecessarily..i love what the bible teaches us about the tongue. “a bit in the mouth of a horse controls the whole horse. a small rudder on a huge ship in the hands of a skilled captain sets a course in the face of the strongest winds. a word out of your mouth may seem of no account  but it can accomplish nearly anything—or destroy it! it only takes a spark  remember  to set off a forest fire. a careless or wrongly placed word out of your mouth can do that. by our speech we can ruin the world  turn harmony to chaos  throw mud on a reputation  send the whole world up in smoke and go up in smoke with it…” and “you can tame a tiger  but you can’t tame a tongue—it’s never been done.”.we have the power to use our words to give life or to bring death to our relationships. hurtful words can be used in slander  gossip  arguing  criticizing  complaining  distasteful language  boasting  and lying. and the damage can be irreparable. as we read that list  we shake our heads for we clearly know others who do these things. yet  there’s a small voice within us that whispers  “could this be me?”.i believe we are all guilty of some or all of these things. for the sake of brevity  let’s focus on the first two: gossip and slander. by definition  gossip is sharing personal or sensational facts about others; sharing private information with those who are not part of the problem or solution. slander is using words  tonal patterns or facial expressions to deliberately damage someone else’s reputation with information that does not need to be shared..we all do this either subtly or with as much gusto as possible  and perhaps we are not aware of the damage we are doing. i am most grieved by those who teach and preach against gossip and yet do so under the guise of caring for the person they are talking about  or worse  having the need to play the victim role and share how unfair someone treated them..it takes intentionality to not step foot on the slippery slope of gossip and slander. it is not easy  but i am committing to these steps  thanks to louie’s inspiration:.paws.pause: there is power in the pause. when we pause before speaking  we gain time to process our thoughts. i’d rather make people uncomfortable with my pause than with my words. i’ve never regretted my pauses  but too many times  i have regretted my words..ask: ask yourself these things: what’s going on with me? why do i have this need to share this? would i want this person sharing information about me? would i share this if the other person were in front of me? reflect on your answers before you speak..wisdom: choose your words wisely. when we speak from a place of wisdom  people are more inclined to listen. carefully consider the words you are about to say. if they are not life-giving  do not say them. nothing good comes from useless  mindless words..stop and seek to understand: stop gossiping for one day. when we want to lose weight  we log our food to keep track of what we are putting into our bodies. take a day this week to log how many times you talk about someone else. that may make you more aware of how easily gossip has seeped into your life. then ask a friend to hold you accountable when you are together  and commit to not talking about others. seek to understand the other person before casting judgement..through my relationship with louie  i have learned a tremendous amount about my relationships with humans. with the size of his mouth  he could take a chunk out of someone  but he clearly chooses not to (up to this point). in that same way  i want nothing to stand in my way with those who are in my life  even those with whom i interact for a short time. i am going to stamp out gossip and slander in my life using the paws method. i hope you will join me..categories

danisedistasi.recently i was thinking of getting another dog. louie is home alone so often  and i worry he gets lonely when i’m not around. he gets plenty of exercise thanks to sully and his mom  but he’s a pack animal  and i don’t think i’m enough “pack” for him..but then i remember my first doggie duo. my daughter marisa and i were convinced that buffy  the first dog we owned together  was lonely and needed a buddy. so we brought a very energetic bichon puppy named bree home when buffy was 3-years-old…she was buffy’s worst nightmare..then after buffy died  we adopted cece. cece wanted me all to herself  which was not going to happen as long as bree was around. after they passed within three years of each other  i took a break from any more doggie drama. and now there’s louie!.but i noticed something interesting about louie. he loves his buddies and will whine to go out to play  but when he’s done  he comes home and quietly goes to his man cave. he has a spot in my bedroom and a crate on the lower level of my home and he prefers that no one invade his privacy. after observing his behavior over the last two plus years  it is clear he loves to be alone. even when i’m home  he is not under my feet. he will go into his crate while i am working or go to his favorite spot to look out the window..perhaps this is a learned behavior after living with me since 2013. i love to be alone. i enjoy the quietness of my home  and i reenergize by spending time alone. i plan for plenty of white space on my calendar for that purpose. i guard that time because it is precious to me. i would never be able to pour into people as i do if i did not have plenty of time alone..the reactions i receive when i tell people i’m an introvert ranges from utter disbelief to acknowledgement that they catch a glimpse of introversion occasionally. the audiences i speak to are usually the ones who display disbelief because their idea of an introvert is not someone who is comfortable giving speeches. i learned many years ago from my friend  lynne ruhl  the primary difference between an introvert and an extrovert. she asked one simple question: you’ve been around people all day at work or at a social event. upon arriving home you receive a call from a friend who invites you to a party. would you turn around and head out to the party or politely decline to stay home? i didn’t hesitate…stay home!.she explained that it doesn’t mean i am shy or socially awkward or even afraid of public speaking. it simply means i recharge by being alone..the terms extrovert and introvert refer to the ways people use their energy. these words have psychological meaning that is different from the way they are used in everyday language. everyone spends some time extroverting and some time introverting. don’t confuse introversion with shyness or reclusiveness. they are not related and i am far from shy..and things get really tricky when you throw in a new term ambivert  a word used to describe someone who exhibits qualities of both introversion and extroversion. stop it! i’m an introvert who functions quite well in an extroverted world  and i love my time alone..good leaders understand that people have differing ways of directing their energies. not everyone will respond the same way even in the same situations. have your extroverted employees that have woo as a strength (winning others over) go to the social networking events. be aware of what energizes and what drains all your employees..i sometimes wonder if the superficiality of our culture today  thanks to social media  hasn’t made me more keenly aware of being introverted. as someone who is very relational  my connection with others is key to my well-being. yet  i still prefer time alone rather than engage in any insincere or phony relationship. and now i have an introverted dog that lives with me  and i’m thankful we are so compatible. he makes coming home even more of a welcome reprieve..categories

and i took a long  quick-paced walk. as we headed into the homestretch  we slowed  and louie stopped to investigate a grassy area. suddenly he took three hops and then pounced on a tunnel that clearly contained a live mole running for its life just a few inches underground..louie was unstoppable. with his long snout he dug  snorted  clawed  and tore away chunks of grass. i was amazed as i watched him and could only imagine the mole’s heart racing as it made its way under a fence to safety. louie made it clear that no mole is safe in his neighborhood. and with that he turned  puffed out his chest  and pranced away..i’ve never seen louie hop  but the bounce in his step and the sheer determination in his hot pursuit of the mole made me smile. rather than walk away in defeat  he strutted off knowing he did exactly what he was created to do—hunt moles..as we walked i wondered about being created for a purpose. louie instinctively knows to track a scent  and nothing deters him once he is on one. but what about you as a leader or those you lead? are you doing what you were created to do? are you providing the environment for your direct reports to do what they’ve been created to do? very few people do  and you immediately recognize those who are: the speaker who captivates you till the end  the author who unlocks a truth deep within  the woodworker who takes your breath away with his talent  the businesswoman who builds a relationship while providing the exact solution needed  and the teacher who watches another class graduate..yet so many times people are placed in roles because a function needs to be filled. the frustration builds when a particular position is not at all what that person was designed to do. for instance  a company just lost its vice president of sales. the organization already has a successful account manager  and due to budget and time constraints  management decides to promote this employee into the role. it is unlikely that the account manager will be successful because he or she may not be a hunter or is uncomfortable going after a deal. most account managers prefer to nurture accounts  follow a process  and assist customers with their experience. as a result  sales will suffer and the new vice president  once thriving and successful  will suffer as well..once we recognize that we aren’t doing what we were created to do  we may feel a prolonged level of dissatisfaction. that’s when it is time to take stock and make changes:.listen to your gut. we’ve heard that intuition or following our heart gets us into trouble  but most of the time  there is a reason for that gnawing feeling that something is just not right. listen to it and investigate; dig around to find out what’s causing these feelings..listen to and watch others. i remember the movie chariots of fire  about the olympic runner eric liddell  who explains to his sister  “i believe god made me for a purpose  but he also made me fast. and when i run i feel his pleasure.” as you see others light up and recognize their purpose  take note of the times you have felt a high level of energy when you were doing a certain task..passion is another way to understand what you were created for. there are certain issues that fire you up. even as you read this  you can think of one or two. take the necessary next step to get involved in such causes. don’t let the uncertainty of the second step keep you from taking the first step.*.what are you gifted in? what do people ask you for help with? what drains you  and what gives you energy? recognize that the life-giving activities are the ones you were created to do..the good news is that we were all created for a purpose  and we all have different purposes. once we understand what we are created for  life becomes so much more rewarding. imagine yourself as a leader helping those around you find their purpose..be aware-not everyone will appreciate your purpose or calling. i’ve blogged about the dream slayers in our lives. this is very similar. there are people who would rather have mole tunnels and rows of dead grass in their yard than a hound dog burrowing his nose in the ground. i recently gave a speech and challenged people to assess the lies in their life that cause them to hide behind a façade. not everyone wants to face that challenge. i’ve been called to help women be strong  bold and humble without being pushy  rude or weak. achieving that balance means first addressing the lie that knocked us off kilter..as for my little buddy louie—he is not a retriever; he’s a hunter. he is in his element when he hunts moles. he can pick up the scent of a mole several yards away. although i am really proud of his ability to scare them away  i don’t want to know what on earth he will do if he actually catches one. stay tuned!.* henry blackaby.out  damned mole! out  i say!.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  forgiveness  fundamentals in

his tolerance (or occasional intolerance) of guests in our home. you’ve been introduced to his chest-bumping pal  mick  his walking buddy sully and his steady girls eve and ellie. but we’ve not talked about sampson much. that’s because there’s not much to talk about. sampson (or sammy) is just a steady as you go  no drama kind of pup. and louie loves that because louie needs steady and stable..louie and sammy met a few years ago. sampson is an adorable pug who is occasionally stubborn while walking with his mom. but louie rarely sees that side of sammy. the pups happily acknowledge each other and then just walk side by side. sammy waddles  louie prances  and the pace seems to work for them both..lou can be who he is when he’s with sampson. he can just simply be. it’s almost as though he lets out a long sigh and says  “hey buddy.” and then they just walk together. they don’t romp around or chase each other. they just stroll..while i have many friends and family members who love me just as i am  my lifetime friend gina has known me since the day i was born. our parents were friends long before we came along and despite their moving to l.a. when gina and i were three  our parents remained friends and my friendship with gina deepened over the years. to this day  gina and i talk regularly and visit as often as possible..the best thing about gina is that i can be my authentic self with her. i don’t have to perform or jump through hoops or pretend or walk on egg shells. i learned about the power of vulnerability decades ago because my friendship with gina helped me see the areas in my life that kept me from being real. it wasn’t a book or a training session or a counselor  although those are great tools. it was the power of relationship that brought me to where i am today..much like louie and sampson  gina and i don’t have to be talking to feel close and can simply bask in the golden silence of true friendship. we have shared life’s sorrows including death of loved ones  divorce  remarriage and we’ve shared life’s joys such as the birth of each other’s children. we can call at 3 a.m. and one of us will answer the phone with  “what’s wrong?” we’ve been through sickness  job promotions  sixty birthdays and many kauai sunsets. through thick and thin  we will always be best friends..i know gina loves me enough to address a character flaw she may see in me long before others do. i trust her to be honest and caring  so i welcome her feedback. some leaders think they are above feedback but without it  they can end up with negative consequences that affect their relationships as well as their job performance. we all need friends in our lives who act as a stopgap to our bad behavioral choices. and we must be willing to listen..every leader needs a gina! and every leader needs to hear when their gina says  “i’m not sure about that.” just as every louie needs a sampson  a steady as you go  let’s walk side by side pal who cares more about you than they do themselves. these kinds of friends truly enrich our lives and make us better people  leaders…or pets!.me and gina (left)  1956 (and my sister donna 🙂.me and gina–still crazy after all

2016 february 21  2016 by danisedistasi.“why did you get that dog anyway?” my friend  lynne  asked as we were eating  exasperated with louie who had finally settled down after attacking her at the door. “he’s so different from what you’ve been used to.” (see picture of my past dogs to the left)..good question  i thought to myself. why did i get him? as i’m typing  he is trying to “bury” his chewy toy behind the sofa in the family room  and i have to shake my head and wonder. i’ve been accustomed to soft and fluffy  somewhat dainty  little dogs. there is nothing soft and fluffy about louie  and certainly nothing dainty! and on days where the temperature is -5 degrees and we have to “go” outside  i have to ask why?.well  i love him  first and foremost. and i did choose him  and it was not an emotional decision. he had character and a presence and i knew he needed me…and i needed him. that’s not how we typically select our employees  but sometimes when we accept a leadership position  there are people we lead whom we would like to help find other jobs. we shake our heads and wonder why on earth they are part of our team..they may not act in familiar ways  they may seem a bit quirky  and there are probably days we wish they would simply resign. then we start seeing signs of hope  we genuinely give affirmations and suddenly  we see improvement  ever so slight  but it’s there. we notice their contributions to the team  and our one-on-one times are more fulfilling. we notice that they have hidden exceptional characteristics and potential  even though they lack what we believe they need in order to be an exceptional employee..just like louie  some people we lead are diamonds in the rough. they appear very ordinary at first glance  and their true beauty as jewels is only realized through a very difficult process. a good leader is often faced with the dilemma of either taking time to invest in a person or deciding it’s time to let them go..i believe every interaction we have with another human being has a purpose. and when i find myself spending time with someone because our roles intertwine  i must take a look at how i can best invest in this person’s life. i am willing to invest in others who:.show genuine interest in professional and personal growth.have a sense of self awareness and a personal vision.are open to and welcome feedback  coaching and mentoring.are committed to learning.are willing to take risks.posses self-management skills.as leaders we must be willing to invest in others  especially those who are so different from our expectations. sometimes we toss people aside because they don’t meet our needs or measure up to our standards. a good leader recognizes that some people are placed in our life for the very purpose of refining us. are we willing to give them our time  and invest in them? i realize there are times we do need to help others find another job  but most times it takes a refining process to bring out the best in others  and ourselves..louie is still burying his chewy and i am still shaking my head. i don’t mind spending time pouring into him because i see the potential and personality and i am the richer person for giving away my heart and my time!.categories balance of strong  be authentic  conflict  consistency  courage  fear and pride  fundamentals in leadership  healthy culture  hidden

danisedistasi.i’ve noticed something a bit different lately about louie  my rescue pup. he really enjoys it when we walk side by side during our walks. what’s different about that  you might ask?.he’s always enjoyed our time together and is usually all over the place when we walk. to get him to walk right next to me (as we’ve been taught during dog training)  i usually have to make him heel. what’s different now is that he heels without me giving the command. now he walks right next to me  many times for the entire walk  enjoying every step. it’s like we’re bffs just hanging out. well  maybe we are  but this change in our walks together gives me paws to think about leadership..louie walks next to me with confidence and joy because i  his leader  am walking with confidence and joy. this time last year i was still recuperating from a terrible accident. and  needless to say  this winter  though i was out walking  i walked with extreme caution. now that the weather is turning warmer  there’s a bit more spring in my step and i am back to walking confidently and fast. and louie is reaping the benefits..when i say  “leader  you must walk with confidence ” it may conjure up a lot of different thoughts and feelings about leadership. many leaders walk with confidence because of pride issues  others put on airs and act like they’re confident. i believe the leaders who truly are confident provide a safe place for employees to flourish. those leaders are confident not in their own abilities but in the abilities and strengths of those they lead. they can walk with confidence because they have a team around them they believe in  one they have encouraged and affirmed  and they work well together..walking with confidence is not about you  it is about those you lead  those you’ve empowered to be who they were created to be. it’s not about you puffing yourself up  it’s about those who choose to follow you and the confidence they have in you to be an excellent leader. take the challenge and walk with confidence  but be sure it is because of the outward focus you have on the strengths and skills of others on your team..as for louie  well  i’m pretty sure if he were writing this it would be all about his confidence and how he walks next to me to make sure i am protected. way to go  louie! such a good boy!.*********.louie had to say goodbye to his cousin  perry  a couple

there are plenty of moles to go around..february 6  2018 february 6  2018 by danisedistasi.for some reason  this winter has made the ground in our neighborhood very susceptible to moles. you can’t walk in a grassy area without walking over a tunnel dug underground by a mole. and of course  louie  my adopted pup  is keenly aware of his nemeses lurking just under the surface everywhere he steps..as we were enjoying one of the unseasonably warm days recently  i noticed louie had a little extra spring in his step. he was ready to pounce at any given time to expose a mole—or several  if need be. after all  this is what he was created for  and it was his duty to rid our community of as many moles as he could. his fans were counting on him to fulfill his calling..and pounce he did—several times  in fact—and chased away one or two of the little critters. as we got closer to our home  he found a mound that was especially inviting. he dug and dug and snorted and pulled away clumps of grass with his mouth  and nothing was going to stop him from his responsibility..then along came louie’s friend  mick—his goldendoodle pal from across the street. louie pulled his head out of the dirt and ran over to play with mick. then mac came along  and the three of them jumped and played; it seemed the role of the mighty mole hunter was all but forgotten. that is until mick got a little too close to the molehill and louie gave him a firm warning. “that’s my molehill  buddy ” louie seemed to snarl. then mac stepped a little too close to the molehill  and louie had all he could take. he made it clear he did not want anyone stepping any closer to the molehill because he had put so much work into digging that hole and possibly finding his treasure..the humans laughed and shrugged it off as one of his many quirky behaviors. once mick and mac left  louie went back to digging  clearly not willing to share the findings  should any be uncovered..as i pulled him away to finish our walk  i shook my head at how possessive and territorial he can be sometimes. i mean  to snarl at his friends just because they were a little too close to the molehill he was working on so diligently? and yet  this gave me great pause. isn’t that just like us regarding our businesses?.many people in business today are no different than louie. they safeguard their information like a child who wraps his arms around his dinner plate making sure no one in the family has an opportunity to steal his food. i do understand the delicate balance of sharing and yet maintaining the quality of intellectual property  but many people  especially in the business-consulting circle  believe they have the market cornered when it comes to their particular information and design..i have great news! there is nothing new under the sun  and there is plenty of business to go around. while cooperation is essential for teams within organizations  how well do you collaborate with other businesses? i have been blessed with excellent collaborative partnerships throughout the years and have found that working together is much better than competing against one another (i know  competition is good to a certain point)..what i have learned through collaboration is the following:.i have strengths and skill sets others may not have and vice versa. combined  we make a strong team and will work on one or two projects together to test the water..i have business contacts others may not have and vice versa. we don’t need to share every contact  but we may find some in common and others that we may simply provide an introduction to..i learn so much more and provide such a greater service to my clients from brainstorming with others who are also in the same business i am in..i’ve enjoyed learning from the best: lynne ruhl (perfect10 corporate cultures)  t. d. hughes (former ceo and chair of the board of larosa’s)  bob pautke (lead clermont and soar consultancy) and ken blanchard (author of the one minute manager)..i am still in partnership with the ken blanchard companies and enjoy maintaining a connection with ken and meeting with michelle shone (business development agent  the ken blanchard companies) on a regular basis. i learned a valuable lesson from ken many years ago. when he shares the wisdom he’s learned from someone else  he always gives that person credit and honors his or her name and calling in life by doing so. he has done this for the 18 years i have known him  and he still does it today..i know all too many people who take credit for work  material  and ideas they had nothing to do with bringing to fruition. yet  they never give people the proper credit and are perfectly happy with allowing people to believe they are the originators. this is stealing  not collaboration. and it fosters a sense of insecurity and negative response  exactly the way louie behaved..although it would have taken me awhile to get louie to understand that had mick and mac joined in the hunt for the mole  the three of them might have been successful in finding one or two moles. instead  we have a big hole in the ground  a very messy dog  and no mole..look for ways to collaborate with others  even those who may seem to be fishing in the same pond as you. it will foster a sense of cooperation and accomplishment—and you may learn a thing or two. just remember to give proper credit where credit is due..i could not resist adding a few pictures of my favorite girls with their hero  fiona the hippo.categories balance of strong  be

curb like he is walking on a balance beam. and he’s quite good! in fact  many times he will run on the curb and not miss a beat. i joked with our trainer  zig  sometime back that we should get louie into agility training. zig kindly reminded me that louie would need more obedience training before he could handle an agility class..it was wise advice  but curiosity got the better of me. i looked into a place that has an easy-to-use obstacle course where dogs chase a lead through tunnels and over bars  and they don’t need prior training. so my granddaughter  evi  joined louie and i as we checked out this fun adventure..it was evident from the start that louie would have nothing to do with chasing a silly lead on a wire aimed at getting him to jump or run. i’m sure if the lead had a treat on it  he might have been persuaded  but that was not part of the plan. so evi jumped into the ring and started running with him  and the two of them had a blast. that lasted one cycle until his attention went elsewhere. evi tried to get him to chase her  but louie was done. he clearly was not going to jump through any more hoops and in fact  desperately tried to find a way to escape..and escape he did. he found a small opening in the fence and took off running through the outside area that didn’t appear to be enclosed. my trainer told me never to chase louie if he gets loose because he’ll think it’s a game. but i was afraid of what could happen if he ran into the busy street. as louie’s ears flapped in the wind and his tongue hung out to the side  the chase was on. i jumped over a small fence and ran at high speed to tackle him and bring him safely back into the ring. i did all this while yelling at evi to stay put because i didn’t want to worry about her as well. but she was too enthralled by the sight of my running and jumping that she wasn’t going anywhere..as we were driving home  i asked louie  “why do you run away from us? do you realize if you run away i will not be behind you? you’ll be lost! don’t you remember what it was like being on the streets all alone?” evi chimed in with a sad face  “yeah  louie  that was scary. don’t ever do that again!” i smiled as i looked at my pup through the rearview mirror  his tongue still hanging out and a big smile on his face as though he had achieved a major accomplishment. but i said  “i can’t blame you  lou! i don’t like to jump through hoops either.” louie sat regally staring out the window as we drove in silence toward home..as i reflected on that incident  i realized that louie was not going to jump through hoops or run around a path and  like most humans  he looked for the quickest escape route. i was reminded of an organization i once worked with that was one of the most toxic cultures i had ever experienced because the leader expected the employees to jump through hoops on a continual basis. what made it so toxic was that the image portrayed to the public was completely different than that of the actual culture. every employee walked on eggshells out of fear of the employer  and they knew that if they spoke the truth  they could be out of a job..over the years  i have witnessed and heard about many toxic workplaces. how do you know when a culture is toxic and a leader is self-serving? it is not so easy to determine just by observing. it takes experiencing the culture and often  by the time the determination is made  the damage is done. but here are some signs:.people are afraid to be themselves  and honest conversations are a rarity..the leader works hard at displaying a perfect image outside the organization and “talks” about how great the culture is..there is a revolving door of employees (turnover numbers can be masked)..there is a pattern of disgruntled employees and broken relationships..the team picture changes every year because the team is totally different every year..when employees leave  relationships end (heaven forbid should the outside world truly know what’s going on inside).employees are nervous and stop trying to please the leader because they know nothing ever will..words of affirmation are rarely given..the leader only shares stories that cast him or her in a positive light..there are small blips of successes here and there  but overall  growth is stagnant..they cultivate an image to hide their insecurities and fears..a self-serving leader reads this list and says  “thank goodness i’m nothing like that.”.the servant leader reads this list and says  “but for the grace of god  there go i!”.i could go on  but i’m sure you get the picture. many wonderful leaders have a servant’s heart and care more for others than themselves. and because they are servant leaders  their businesses continue to enjoy sustainable growth  and employees are recognized for their part in the success. their employees enjoy going to work in the morning instead of getting that knotted feeling every sunday evening because of what they have to face on monday. the best servant leaders are those who have removed their egos  are authentic and focused on others. be intentional about being a servant leader..as for louie…well  we’ll work on his agility and

behaviors. he does not want any other dog to enter into our home. and he’s not too fond of humans walking in either  but he tolerates them. this behavior is displayed only in my home and it wears on me..but then it occurred to me. i have been lax in my being a consistent alpha to louie. you see  90% of the time  louie is a very well-behaved dog  and he minds well. and for this reason  i have let some little bad behaviors slip through the crack. this creates a chain effect of louie thinking he can get by with those bad behaviors; getting on the furniture  getting into the trash  getting on the beds. because he sometimes gets by with that behavior and other times not  this causes confusion for louie. and when he’s confused  he operates in fear. it’s my fault that louie is confused and feels the need to be territorial and protective..one of the toughest principles for me to grasp over the years since louie first came to live with me was how to be the alpha in louie’s “pack ” and my trainer was clear that i was a weak alpha. my lack of strong leadership confused louie  forcing him into the position of having to step up and lead  and that issue still exists today..before louie and i found each other  i never gave much thought to asserting my role as alpha dog. consequently  my dogs assumed that role  and i let them. it didn’t seem to matter because they were small and harmless. and by the time i got home after a long day at work  i was tired of being alpha  so i let them boss me around. but that approach doesn’t work for louie  and it does not work for people.there is so much that goes into being a good alpha; being consistent  providing safety  setting appropriate boundaries  giving genuine and abundant praise  and offering a necessary correction. again  all of those things must be rooted in trust and undergirded by love..i remember back four years ago when the trainer first met us  louie behaved very badly  and i was at my wit’s end. the trainer described my body language as defeated. louie responded to this with fear and confusion. the words that moved me off the dime were  “i’ve seen you do leadership seminars  now you’ve got to do what you do in those workshops. exude confidence. he needs reassurance that you know what you’re doing.”.really? for my dog? i had made the common mistake of assuming that he would instinctively know that i’m the boss – simply because i’m the human  i’m larger than he  and i think more “knowledgeable.” the trainer taught me that it is about my level of confidence in where i’m going and what needs to be accomplished. that confidence is in knowing what’s best for louie  giving him firm direction  and drawing out his very best behavior..as leaders  our assumptions about others and situations around us unintentionally confuse our team. we have expectations that are not always clearly communicated  and then when not met  cause disappointment on our part and confusion on the part of others. ken blanchard often refers to this as seagull management  meaning a manager who only interacts with employees when a problem arises. this style of leadership involves hasty decisions about things of which they have little understanding  resulting in messy situations for others to clean up..being a strong leader is about so much more than claiming an impressive title  wearing expensive clothes and appearing important. it is about:.owning the leadership role we’ve been given.resisting the urge to react out of our own fears and insecurities.addressing problems before we lose our cool.effectively communicating the vision and seeking to understand our team.dogs and people need a humble leader  not a bossy dictator. i’ve committed to leading with intentionality  clear vision and goals. i encourage you to do the same – whether you’re leading canines or humans..i am happy to say i have assumed my role as alpha of the house. louie needs and desires my approval much more than he wants to be alpha  and consequently  louie is a much happier pup. i’ve had to wrestle him to the ground once or twice to make him understand submission  a method i do not recommend for your team. but it is clear that he understands and appreciates my love and leadership. and i now know the value of being consistent in my leadership role..check out our new website: di-advisors.com.categories balance of

down the street toward our home. a neighbor was getting into her car and stopped to stare at louie as he proudly pranced by. we exchanged hellos  and she smiled at lou and said  “he’s such a good boy.” i just laughed and nodded..he looked at me and i at him  and i thought  “he is a pretty good dog.” but then i continued that conversation in my head: “well  most of the time. i mean  sometimes  he can be a bit  well  let’s just say mischievous.” quite honestly  he is a totally different dog than he was during our first few months together..louie’s transformation was no accident—i was very intentional in making changes in my life and my leadership style  and it took a lot of work..the one thing.but the most transformative power in our journey together was my decision to be a loving person and to pour love into little louie. i saw a significant difference in his behavior a few months into our time together and continue to see today  four years later!.sadly  the word “love” receives eye rolls and shoulder shrugs. the word gets tossed around frequently these days in every circle that wants to claim it is the most loving. we see countless hateful facebook posts and counter posts on how we need to love. over four years ago  in my first louie’s leadership lessons blog post  i took a chance and wrote about showing lou unconditional love  knowing how the world viewed the “l-word”  especially in the workplace. yet as we conduct more and more louie speeches and workshops  one thing that is always consistent is the total misunderstanding of the word love..a few months after my blog post on love  harvard business review published a study demonstrating that employees perform better when they feel loved. the study made a distinction between friendship love and romantic love  mainly that friendship love is based on warmth  affection  and connection rather than passion. the study revealed  “it is the small moments between coworkers—a warm smile  a kind note  a sympathetic ear—day after day  month after month  [danise’s note: on a consistent basis] that help create and maintain a strong culture of companion love and the employee satisfaction  productivity  and client satisfaction that comes with it.”.stop it and why!.so here’s my challenge to you today: stop training and coaching your staff in hopes of seeing change. be the leader who genuinely loves! unless you’re capable of showing authentic love to others  you will most likely cultivate a very toxic culture within your organization  family  and community. don’t confuse being nice with demonstrating love. they are two different qualities. love is a heart issue!.on the flip side  my observation has been that bosses who try to manufacture these qualities but demonstrate behavior to the contrary engender fear and mistrust among their employees..the how.may i be so bold as to take this a step further? i think it is virtually impossible to feel joy or experience peace in your life if you’re incapable of true genuine love. most of us do not understand love. so let me help you. here’s the tip of the iceberg of what i’ve been learning over four years of studying and blogging about louie and love:.love is an alignment of the whole self toward what is good and right..love must be aimed at and practiced. it takes work; as martin luther king  jr.  said  “it takes strength to love.”.love is not turned on and turned off for this person or for that it is consistently who you are..to demonstrate love  be a person possessed by love  so that you can go to an adversary as a loving person rather than going to an adversary and then trying to love that person..love arises out of a pure heart..love is directed toward what is good and right from the depths of ourselves  from which actions come..if we take care of the sources of actions  the actions will take care of themselves..love itself is patient  kind  trustworthy  true; not prideful  doesn’t hold on to grudges and is humble. we are to pursue love  and the rest takes care of itself..seek what is best and what is true. truth is sometimes very hard to share and to hear. yet many times  it is the most loving aspect of a genuine relationship..love is not something you choose to do but what or who you choose to be..look for the sources of malice in yourself and focus efforts upon grace to change them..malice is rooted in how we think of people—as objects—with little understanding of who they are or the difficulties they may have experienced in their lives..finally  love is the willingness to serve others for the greater good  above our own wants..there’s no way you can be patient with others  show kindness  have integrity  be faithful to your word  be gentle  or exhibit self-control without love. all of these excellent characteristics are rooted in love. and as leaders  we must be people of love  not just doers of nice things. check your motives and your hearts..where transformation truly begins.it wasn’t easy for me to show consistent  genuine love to louie. and it has been even more difficult to show love to people who are unlovable  demanding  or different from me—or those who have disappointed me. but i know what true love is  and i stand amazed that god so loves me! who am i to withhold that love from people who may need it most?.i chose louie  difficult personality and all. granted  we usually do not get to choose those we are commanded to love in the workplace. but people in your space could be transformed because you choose to love them..categories balance of strong

danisedistasi.with the recent beautiful weather  louie and i have been taking long walks and enjoying our time together. louie is a pretty happy pup lately and trots down the street with a prance that matches his joyful heart..but then there’s this girl. you see  she’s absolutely beautiful with striking white fur and pale-blue eyes lined in black. she’s a tall  slim husky/shepherd mix  and louie is not quite sure what to think of her. apparently  she is also confused about him when they pass on the street..you lookin’ at me?.in his usual tough guy style  he gives her a look that says  “are you lookin’ at me? uh  you lookin’ at me?”.she then stands a little taller and looks down at him as if to say  “what are you talking about? you’re lookin’ at me!” he puffs his chest out and she pushes her nose at him  and before you know it they are huffing and puffing and challenging one another. with a slight tug on his leash and my usual command to “leave it ” we continue on our walk..now these two have had great interactions before  and  based on louie’s body language and tone of voice  he’s not aggressively challenging her. but i find it interesting that his bad behavior provokes her bad behavior and  if allowed  it may escalate to a more serious challenge..i noticed this too with his little buddy  mac. louie typically ignores him  but when mac is unusually “active ” louie seems to chime right in and become an obnoxious pup by playing rough (with me  not another dog) or ignoring me when it is time to settle down..our work teams are very similar. although a smile or a word of affirmation from a coworker can spread good cheer in the workplace  bad behavior and rudeness are also contagious. being rude or impolite to your coworkers can lead them to behave the same way  negatively affecting our culture and productivity..as leaders  rudeness should not be tolerated in our work or homes. while there may be many reasons for someone to be in a bad mood and react negatively  it is our responsibility as leaders to demonstrate that even under unpleasant circumstances it is never okay to be rude and disrespectful. so what are we to do?.it seems the “leave it” command works well for louie  and it works well for me  too. “leave it” doesn’t mean to ignore the situation and hope it goes away. it simply means to not dwell on it and let the emotion subside. oswald chambers  an early twentieth-century scottish theologian and teacher  said over a century ago  “there is always at least one more fact  which we know nothing about  in every person’s situation.”.this is a good time to revisit the paws method. when someone is rude and your first inclination is to become upset and respond rudely  try this method to help you analyze the situation before doing something you may regret:.pause—breathe! allow oxygen to get to your brain. you may need to walk away for a bit and then revisit the situation. there is power in the pause. when we pause before speaking  we gain time to process our thoughts..ask questions: “what’s going on?” “can you tell me more?” “can you help me understand?” “is everything okay?” ask yourself these things: is there something else going on in this person’s life? what’s going on with me? why does this aggravate me? reflect on your answers before you speak..wisdom: choose your words wisely. i would much rather have people feel uncomfortable waiting for me to find the right words than allowing myself to get sucked into poor behavior. carefully consider the words you are about to say. if they are not life-giving  do not say them. nothing good comes from useless  mindless words..seek to understand: once you pause  ask questions  and choose your words wisely  you will naturally seek to understand. remember  everyone has “stuff” in his or her backgrounds. and so do you!.there is no reason to tolerate rudeness in our workplace  and studies have shown that bad behavior begets bad behavior. we have a responsibility as leaders to stop that behavior in order to maintain or restore a healthy culture..as for louie and his beautiful tall cool blonde friend  i think they may secretly like each other. i may have to help him a bit with showing girls his interest. so far he’s not scoring any points  but i still love him..my bad little dog  talented as he may be. he actually pulled a towel out of the laundry basket and somehow wrapped himself in it and settled in for a nap!.click here to sign up for louie’s emails.through lessons learned from a well-loved rescue pup  a leadership model emerges

thought drifted through my mind the other day: i will miss all the love and attention i have received over the past few weeks. but since i would rather hear “wow  you’re doing so well” than “oh  gee  sorry you’re still struggling with your recovery ” the thought passed quickly  never to return..because i’m ready to close the chapter on my accident and subsequent surgery  my passing thought is not what the subject line is referring to. this is a blog about my persnickety pup louie and his ever-increasing need to whine. while i know he suffered trauma over the past couple of months along with me  his whining seems to have increased exponentially rather than to have subsided as i would have expected. i soon discovered his behavior has nothing to do with my injury. instead  louie is reacting to a new dog in the neighborhood..this new dog represents everything louie hates. the dog is a male  he’s bigger than lou  and he’s . . . shhhh . . . not neutered. the last issue sends louie into a tizzy even before we walk out the door. his hackles go up  and he puffs out his chest and huffs as he walks out. but then the incessant whining begins. and once he starts that  it’s tough to get him to stop..one morning as we exited the garage  we made a sharp left turn out of our driveway and hurried away from where the dog lives as quickly as a girl with a cane can manage. louie looked back  whined  and seemed disoriented. i tugged on his collar and gave a stern command  “leave it ” which he immediately obeyed  but his memory is keen  and it quickly took him back to the dark side. i was hoping he would find a new smell to distract him..thanks to zig our dog trainer  i learned a long time ago that louie whines out of fear  so i have to step up and walk with confidence. that’s tough to do considering i’m still healing  but i did the best i could. louie suspiciously eyed the cane  and then looked back at me with a face that said he was not convinced i could protect us both . . . and i didn’t blame him..as our walk settled into a more relaxed pace  i reflected on why some people  like louie  seem to whine so much. do you have a few whiners on your team? it’s easy to get frustrated and dismiss them  but there is usually something deeper going on that we may never uncover unless we take the time to do so..fear is a big issue for louie  which is why he whines. fear is a big issue for people as well and could be the reason some folks whine. i have learned to counter louie’s fear  not with my confidence but with love. love is the first step of the louie leadership model:.love is foundational to building trust and integrity for a personal or professional relationship to flourish. without love and trust  our relationships are like fragile shells that have nothing inside of them and with the slightest amount of pressure  are easily shattered. because of the love i have demonstrated for louie on a regular basis  he has learned to trust me. [for more on leading with trust  see this article by my friend  randy conley  vice president of client services & trust practice leader for the ken blanchard companies.].a teammate may whine because the team is experiencing a daunting and uncomfortable change. loving people through such change does not mean we coddle them. it means we shed light on the situation  we share the truth  and we press through together..love is more impactful than complaining to others that someone is a whiner..our society tends to misuse the word love. in fact  very few understand the strength and character it takes to love others. we have fluffy commercials about it  emoticons  and facebook posts. martin luther king  jr. said  “darkness cannot drive out darkness  only light can do that. hate cannot drive out hate  only love can do that.”.and who can argue with this verse: “such love has no fear because perfect love expels all fear. if we are afraid  it is for fear of punishment  and this shows that we have not fully experienced his (god’s) perfect love.”.i doubt louie will be able to love the new dog in the neighborhood anytime soon. in fact  i’m sure he is hoping the dog moves away. in the meantime  i’m working on loving lou through this ordeal and rebuilding his confidence and trust in me so he knows i will never allow another dog to threaten him..but louie is a dog and as humans  we can choose to love. you can be the change agent for someone by removing fear of punishment or detrimental consequences and instilling love instead. such love is the gateway to experiencing god’s perfect love and the cornerstone on which excellent and effective leadership is built..note: my friend t.d. hughes knows how emphatic i am about leadership and love and recently sent me an article i thought you would enjoy as well. it’s okay to love your employees.**speaking of love  louie sends his love for a wonderful valentine’s day**.picture compliments of louie’s favorite place  best friend’s pet center.please click here to sign up for louie’s leadership lessons blog..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  fear and pride  fundamentals in leadership  gossip  healthy culture  honesty  ken blanchard  leadership  moral compromise  people process differently  relationships  respect  the louie model  transparency  trust  truth  uncategorized tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  #louiesleadershiplessons  #toughlessons  healthy relationships 4 comments.has leadership gone to the dogs?.november 28  2016 november 29  2016 by danisedistasi.the subject line might offend louie. in fact  it might offend you as well. but let’s face it—in the heat of the recent political battle  many of us are shaking our heads while trying to understand what just happened. one thing i do know is that disrespect for people with differing opinions is at an all-time high..the rude rhetoric on all sides of the political spectrum gave me pause and made me think of louie and some of his not-so-friendly foes. i am convinced that if people were to act the way our pets do  we would all get along better. for example  sometimes louie might see a dog that challenges him. the two will snarl and growl and perhaps even bark at each other. however  the minute we walk side by side with the dog and its owner  they seem to get along. there is something about being intentional and walking alongside someone you have a disagreement with..louie has done this with my niece’s dog  buddy. those two little boys will scrunch their noses  curl their lips  show their teeth  stand their hair up  and bark in such a high pitch that people turn their heads with a look of concern. andrea laughs  assuring everyone in sight that the dogs are actually cousins and are fine with each other. it sure doesn’t seem like it when they are facing one another. however  as soon as we start walking  they are fine together..louie also behaves this way with rambunctious claire  his other cousin noli  his neighbor snickers  and a new boxer in the community named socks. what is it about being side by side with their supposed nemesis? i think there are several things:.it is less threatening..they are on equal ground..they see the same vision of what lies ahead..they walk with the same pace..it is easier to carry the other’s burden. (okay  this one relates to humans  not louie.).what if some of our leaders were intentional about walking side by side instead of duking it out? i am reminded of an article i wrote in 2005 when i worked with ken blanchard titled “leading with your heart takes humility.” although it was written over eleven years ago  the premise holds true today: humility is the key to excelling in leadership. and servant leaders are humble enough to walk beside someone they disagree with..i won’t share the full article here (you can find it at this link)  but here are some of the highlights:.something is glaringly missing from leadership today. sadly  many leadership programs are missing just one key ingredient: the heart. not just the heart of the issue or the heart of the matter—the heart of the people..what gets in your way? what truly is your motive for being a leader or wanting to lead others? is it for selfish gain or to better others?.many times  our ego gets in the way and what bubbles up out of our hearts are things like pride  selfishness  and even fear..how can you push past what holds you back? in getting past the barriers  is the challenge as a leader to balance confidence with humility to fight ego issues? ken blanchard often uses the quote  “humility is not thinking less of yourself. it’s thinking of yourself less.” every time you make a leadership decision  are you thinking of yourself or others?.confidence does not come from being in a dominant position and leading by intimidation. doing this will cause you to lose respect from others  and any talk about values or integrity will be ignored. humility  however  is not something they teach us in business schools. it is a character trait that is honed over time with truth and love..our businesses  organizations  and families are hungry for leadership coupled with humility. it takes commitment to make the necessary changes to have a healthy culture and humble leaders..perhaps our world could learn a lesson from louie about being intentional and walking side by side with others rather than snarling at them. while louie doesn’t understand humility  his actions speak louder than his woof. he is more than willing to walk alongside others. as i watch his actions  i am convinced that we humans have much to learn from our dogs..louie’s newest revision is now available. click on the book to order..click

comments.unclaimed. unloved. unwavering.october 25  2016 october 25  2016 by danisedistasi.recently  i overheard my oldest granddaughter  evi  share our dog louie’s story with her younger sister  mea. though you may have heard this “tail” a time or two before  i thought you would enjoy this rendition:.“a long time ago  there was a little dog who was all alone in the woods. he was scared and afraid and felt very  very alone. it was nighttime and then daylight and then nighttime  again and again. once  he saw another little animal and thought  ‘oh  that looks like someone who could be my friend.’ but the animal was a mean cat. it hissed and clawed at the poor little dog  scratching his ear till it started to bleed. ‘my ’ said the pup. ‘i guess it doesn’t want to be my friend.’ the little dog still has a mark on his ear..“the poor little dog was sad  but he kept on going because he knew somewhere  someone would love him. he was so tired that he couldn’t keep his head up. he came to a road and a woman who was driving by saw him and picked him up. she took him to a place filled with lots of people and other dogs. the people called and called and called all sorts of places to find out if anyone owned the dog. they put up signs and waited and waited  but no one came to see the little dog. he still felt all alone..“one morning  the people put the little dog in a van and drove him far  far away. they took him to an adopt-a-pet store. there  he saw a nice lady who took him home. he was scared at first  but then the lady opened the door to her home  and two little girls were waiting for him. they hugged him and kissed his head and called him their brother. louie finally found a place he called home and two sisters who loved him very much.”.mea’s mouth dropped open as she squealed  “lou-weeeeee?”.“yep  that’s louie’s story ” evi proudly announced..i smiled as i heard the tale so poignantly shared. once again  louie’s story tugged at my heart as i thought about our little dog wandering the streets and wooded areas  not knowing where he was or where he should go. it is even sadder to think that despite the shelter’s efforts to find his family  no one came to take him home. louie was unclaimed and unloved—a very sad state  indeed..since he first came to live in my home  there has been no question that he is loved. i’ve gladly claimed him as my little pal  and he truly is a brother to evi and mea. he knows where home is. every time we take a walk  he’ll look up at me with those big  brown eyes  and i’ll ask  “do you want to go home  lou?” with a spring in his step and dogged determination  he’ll prance all the way home with little guidance from me. i have been unwavering in working through life’s tough spots to build a relationship of trust  and it has paid off in huge dividends of joy for louie and me as well as for evi  mea  and many other people whom louie has come to know and love..being unclaimed and unloved is not limited to adopted pups. many people in our lives have suffered through this emotional pain. many times  these people are close friends  teammates  bosses  or fellow board members. we never know who they are because  in today’s shallow society  we don’t take the time to learn about people’s lives. we often wonder what is wrong with individuals who act out  but in many cases  these people may be unclaimed and unloved and are looking for others they can trust. don’t be like the cat in louie’s tale and lash out at them..before passing judgment on others  take the time to learn their stories. people are fascinating  and everyone has a unique history. once you learn about someone and take the time to get to know them  you’ll see them blossom and grow. learning about others is imperative to help our team build trust and learn to walk in their strengths. be the leader who is unwavering in working through tough spots to build a relationship of trust. this effort will pay off in huge dividends of joy and—believe it or not—productivity..if you are reading this blog  i want you to know you are not unclaimed or unloved  no matter what has happened to you in your past. god is unwavering in his love for us. it is up to us to joyfully accept and receive such love..as for louie—he has taught me so much about love and determination. i am never without a lesson from this little chap. he has also opened my eyes to that fact that my sweet evi is carrying on the nonna tradition of being the “best story maker” ever. together  she and i gave you a tiny glimpse into what is to come for louie’s leadership lessons. stay

to discuss  one that is also a continuing issue. just when i think louie is over this particular behavior  he reverts to square one  and we have to start training all over again..every time someone comes to my door  he has a very strong reaction; he starts barking  growling  and lowering his head—all signs that he is ready to attack  even though he has never attacked anyone. while this is great for all the intruders that come to my door  it can also be annoying since most are guests or delivering expected packages..my guests will walk in  fully expecting an overly excited dog to greet them. i’ve worked with louie to sit and remain seated until i give him a release signal. only then can he approach the guest and smell the person. but the minute i do not enforce this training  he goes right back to his bad behavior..ever since i’ve known louie  he has had only great experiences at my front door. i have welcomed everyone who has entered with hugs  and they love seeing louie. he has never encountered someone breaking in  trying to kidnap me  or causing any commotion whatsoever at the front door. the people he encounters are simply entering my home..i had to ask myself  what would cause this behavior? did he have a bad past experience? is he afraid someone will take him from his cushy environment? does he not want me to give anyone else any attention? none of this made sense..when i share about his behavior with others  everyone says he is just being protective  and i’m left again to ask why. why does he think i need protection? and if i do need it  then shouldn’t he react the same way when we are on a walk and someone approaches me? but he doesn’t. he could care less. in fact  i am sure that if someone with ill intent approached me  he would run in the opposite direction as fast as he could. he doesn’t care if i pet other dogs  and all my neighbors can attest to this behavior—but only outside..inside my house  it’s a different story. over the last three years  i have realized that louie is indeed protecting his territory. given his history  he has a profound need to feel safe and clearly does not want anyone disrupting that. while i appreciate that and want him to feel safe  it annoys me to fight this battle every time someone comes to my door. being territorial is not very becoming and can turn many people away. i have to shake my head and wonder why dogs  especially louie  behave that way. and then it hit me: i am the very same way. i am territorial..for instance  i struggled with sharing the louie leadership model in our last blog because of the thoughts that slowly began to creep into my mind and heart. someone  i thought  will steal it and call it their own (no one ever does that in the training/consulting world  right?) or say they thought of it first. and so on. such thoughts continued to color my excitement about developing and sharing the model and the louie stories that accompanied each step. while i shake my head and ask louie why he acts like he does  i had to ask myself the same question. what benefit is it to anyone if i am territorial and hoard a new idea?.it is humbling to realize that a behavior is very unbecoming. we humans are so often territorial when we think we have a great idea  a unique method  or a new creation. an old expression often brings me back to reality:.there is nothing new under the sun!.louie’s behavior is typical of most dogs. for humans to want to protect their turf is normal. but just because it is “typical” or “normal” behavior does not mean it is acceptable. i shared the louie model because it is a really great model and not mine to hoard. it was gifted to me by the one who blessed me with louie—god. and i believe god wants me to give freely to others the gifts with which he has blessed me..now if i can just get louie to see our home as a gift that we should share with others  we’d be so much better off! we have a lot of work to do!.***********.louie had to say goodbye to his sweet cousin  lily  last week! our family will always have fond memories of her running around the pool  trying to keep everyone in line. in the last year  she finally realized our

uh  you lookin’ at me?”.she then stands a little taller and looks down at him as if to say  “what are you talking about? you’re lookin’ at me!” he puffs his chest out and she pushes her nose at him  and before you know it they are huffing and puffing and challenging one another. with a slight tug on his leash and my usual command to “leave it ” we continue on our walk..now these two have had great interactions before  and  based on louie’s body language and tone of voice  he’s not aggressively challenging her. but i find it interesting that his bad behavior provokes her bad behavior and  if allowed  it may escalate to a more serious challenge..i noticed this too with his little buddy  mac. louie typically ignores him  but when mac is unusually “active ” louie seems to chime right in and become an obnoxious pup by playing rough (with me  not another dog) or ignoring me when it is time to settle down..our work teams are very similar. although a smile or a word of affirmation from a coworker can spread good cheer in the workplace  bad behavior and rudeness are also contagious. being rude or impolite to your coworkers can lead them to behave the same way  negatively affecting our culture and productivity..as leaders  rudeness should not be tolerated in our work or homes. while there may be many reasons for someone to be in a bad mood and react negatively  it is our responsibility as leaders to demonstrate that even under unpleasant circumstances it is never okay to be rude and disrespectful. so what are we to do?.it seems the “leave it” command works well for louie  and it works well for me  too. “leave it” doesn’t mean to ignore the situation and hope it goes away. it simply means to not dwell on it and let the emotion subside. oswald chambers  an early twentieth-century scottish theologian and teacher  said over a century ago  “there is always at least one more fact  which we know nothing about  in every person’s situation.”.this is a good time to revisit the paws method. when someone is rude and your first inclination is to become upset and respond rudely  try this method to help you analyze the situation before doing something you may regret:.pause—breathe! allow oxygen to get to your brain. you may need to walk away for a bit and then revisit the situation. there is power in the pause. when we pause before speaking  we gain time to process our thoughts..ask questions: “what’s going on?” “can you tell me more?” “can you help me understand?” “is everything okay?” ask yourself these things: is there something else going on in this person’s life? what’s going on with me? why does this aggravate me? reflect on your answers before you speak..wisdom: choose your words wisely. i would much rather have people feel uncomfortable waiting for me to find the right words than allowing myself to get sucked into poor behavior. carefully consider the words you are about to say. if they are not life-giving  do not say them. nothing good comes from useless  mindless words..seek to understand: once you pause  ask questions  and choose your words wisely  you will naturally seek to understand. remember  everyone has “stuff” in his or her backgrounds. and so do you!.there is no reason to tolerate rudeness in our workplace  and studies have shown that bad behavior begets bad behavior. we have a responsibility as leaders to stop that behavior in order to maintain or restore a healthy culture..as for louie and his beautiful tall cool blonde friend  i think they may secretly like each other. i may have to help him a bit with showing girls his interest. so far he’s not scoring any points  but i still love him..my bad little dog  talented as he may be. he actually pulled a towel out of the laundry basket and somehow wrapped himself in it and settled in for a nap!.click here to sign up for louie’s emails.through lessons learned from a well-loved rescue pup  a leadership model emerges that makes the connection to relationships  revealing the small ways leaders can empower their teams every day..click the image for information on how to order louie’s leadership lessons.louie’s leadership lessons are lovingly fed by….categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  ending well  fear and pride  forgiveness  fundamentals in leadership  gossip  healthy culture  honesty  leadership  relationships  respect  the louie model  transparency  trust  truth tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  distasi advisors  healthy cultures  healthy relationships  love  realational leadership leave a comment.will you please stop whining.february 6  2017 february 7  2017 by danisedistasi.a passing thought drifted through my mind the other day: i will miss all the love and attention i have received over the past few weeks. but since i would rather hear “wow  you’re doing so well” than “oh  gee  sorry you’re still struggling with your recovery ” the thought passed quickly  never to return..because i’m ready to close the chapter on my accident and subsequent surgery  my passing thought is not what the subject line is referring to. this is a blog about my persnickety pup louie and his ever-increasing need to whine. while i know he suffered trauma over the past couple of months along with me  his whining seems to have increased exponentially rather than to have subsided as i would have expected. i soon discovered his behavior has nothing to do with my injury. instead  louie is reacting to a new dog in the neighborhood..this new dog represents everything louie hates. the dog is a male  he’s bigger than lou  and he’s . . . shhhh . . . not neutered. the last issue sends louie into a tizzy even before we walk out the door. his hackles go up  and he puffs out his chest and huffs as he walks out. but then the incessant whining begins. and once he starts that  it’s tough to get him to stop..one morning as we exited the garage  we made a sharp left turn out of our driveway and hurried away from where the dog lives as quickly as a girl with a cane can manage. louie looked back  whined  and seemed disoriented. i tugged on his collar and gave a stern command  “leave it ” which he immediately obeyed  but his memory is keen  and it quickly took him back to the dark side. i was hoping he would find a new smell to distract him..thanks to zig our dog trainer  i learned a long time ago that louie whines out of fear  so i have to step up and walk with confidence. that’s tough to do considering i’m still healing  but i did the best i could. louie suspiciously eyed the cane  and then looked back at me with a face that said he was not convinced i could protect us both . . . and i didn’t blame him..as our walk settled into a more relaxed pace  i reflected on why some people  like louie  seem to whine so much. do you have a few whiners on your team? it’s easy to get frustrated and dismiss them  but there is usually something deeper going on that we may never uncover unless we take the time to do so..fear is a big issue for louie  which is why he whines. fear is a big issue for people as well and could be the reason some folks whine. i have learned to counter louie’s fear  not with my confidence but with love. love is the first step of the louie leadership model:.love is foundational to building trust and integrity for a personal or professional relationship to flourish. without love and trust  our relationships are like fragile shells that have nothing inside of them and with the slightest amount of pressure  are easily shattered. because of the love i have demonstrated for louie on a regular basis  he has learned to trust me. [for more on leading with trust  see this article by my friend  randy conley  vice president of client services & trust practice leader for the ken blanchard companies.].a teammate may whine because the team is experiencing a daunting and uncomfortable change. loving people through such change does not mean we coddle them. it means we shed light on the situation  we share the truth  and we press through together..love is more impactful than complaining to others that someone is a whiner..our society tends to misuse the word love. in fact  very few understand the strength and character it takes to love others. we have fluffy commercials about it  emoticons  and facebook posts. martin luther king  jr. said  “darkness cannot drive out darkness  only light can do that. hate cannot drive out hate  only love can do that.”.and who can argue with this verse: “such love has no fear because perfect love expels all fear. if we are afraid  it is for fear of punishment  and this shows that we have not fully experienced his (god’s) perfect love.”.i doubt louie will be able to love the new dog in the neighborhood anytime soon. in fact  i’m sure he is hoping the dog moves away. in the meantime  i’m working on loving lou through this ordeal and rebuilding his confidence and trust in me so he knows i will never allow another dog to threaten him..but louie is a dog and as humans  we can choose to love. you can be the change agent for someone by removing fear of punishment or detrimental consequences and instilling love instead. such love is the gateway to experiencing god’s perfect love and the cornerstone on which excellent and effective leadership is built..note: my friend t.d. hughes knows how emphatic i am about leadership and love and recently sent me an article i thought you would enjoy as well. it’s okay to love your employees.**speaking of love  louie sends his love for a wonderful valentine’s day**.picture compliments of louie’s favorite place  best friend’s pet center.please click here to sign up for louie’s leadership lessons blog..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  fear and pride  fundamentals in leadership  gossip  healthy culture  honesty  ken blanchard  leadership  moral compromise  people process differently  relationships  respect  the louie model  transparency  trust  truth  uncategorized tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  #louiesleadershiplessons  #toughlessons  healthy relationships 4 comments.back to normal  whatever that means!.january 24  2017 january 24  2017 by danisedistasi.our last blog detailed a journey i’m glad to say i am more than halfway through. if all goes well  my release date from all restrictions is february 1  2017. i am off all pain medication  and i took my first solo drive yesterday. i am beginning to see some normalcy slowly trickle back into my life. again  i am completely humbled by the continued outpouring of love and encouragement. thank you!.and then  there’s louie! louie was as traumatized as i was through this journey. he had to adjust to my being gone for two weeks; friends coming and going  walking and feeding him  playing with him  all while he constantly watched the door with the hope i would walk through it any minute..now that i’m home and he’s learned to trust my erratic movements with a cane  he seems to have settled back into some interesting habits: growling at people who come to my door (even his dog walkers) and jumping on the couch to sit directly across from me (better to watch me  he says)..one evening  a friend came by to take louie for a walk. after they finished and she came in to sit with me for awhile  he ran into the house  checked on me  and then ran upstairs  where he ran the length of the hallway several times. then  i heard a big commotion  and from where i was sitting  i could tell what that little rascal was doing. he was getting into my clothesbasket in my bathroom and taking all the clothes out of it  having no consideration whatsoever for the amount of time it took me to get the clothes into that basket..his continued motion  which was evident even though he was a floor above me  indicated he not only removed the items from the basket  he was also rolling in them—all of them! some time ago  i explained to zig  our trainer  louie’s annoying bad habit of rolling in the dirty laundry. i assumed it was because he wanted to surround himself with my smell  weird as that is..but zig assured me that was not it at all. louie was getting his smell on my clothes  showing his dominance over me. what? now that is a really annoying bad habit that makes me realize we are back to square one. there will be no dominance of louie over me..but this is not surprising. when it takes all my energy to walk from the living room to the kitchen  disciplining a dog is not high on my list  especially since we’ve been through this before. the pressure was off of louie to behave well  and when the pressure is off  he reverts back to his old habits..that is so like us. a while ago  i wrote a blog about something i learned from my time with the ken blanchard companies about the dynamics of change. one dynamic is that when the pressure is off  we revert to our original behaviors. well  the pressure was definitely off  and louie was back to some of his old habits. we will need to spend time correcting that. but rather than lament  i reflected on what this means as far as my recent journey and getting “back to normal.”.finally being able to drive did give me a sense of life getting back to normal. getting off medication  walking better  and looking forward to some normalcy were great goals for recovery. but did i really want normalcy to be my goal?.not this time  not this year. i am going to be intentional (keeping the pressure on) about breaking past the norm to live a well-meaning life by doing the following:.pruning activities  objects  and even some relationships  all to devote precious time to what matters;.being kind in thought  word  and deed  whether people deserve it or not. i don’t mean just merely being nice (and sometimes superficial and phony)  but being authentic and loving—speaking truth in love and showing those who differ from me  or have differing viewpoints  the compassion that only comes from faith in god;.taking time to listen in order to learn—and not rushing to the next project;.being still and having plenty of margin in my life;.laughing more; and.dancing (okay  that one is normal for me  but now takes on an even more special meaning). i will take time to dance more with my grandchildren and even my adult daughter because that’s what distasi kids do. my niece sara is getting married in september  and she has promised we will dance the night away. that is my goal for 2017..be intentional about breaking past the norm. life is too short and too easily interrupted for us to stay stuck in the status quo. and you are never too old to take that first step to crashing through the “same ol’  same ol’.”.as for louie  we have some work to do. as i have been writing  he slipped into my laundry room and pulled out a dishtowel. he is so bad. i know he has a large fan base of people who love him  but this annoying little habit just makes me shake my head. i suppose being intentionally kind starts now with little louie distasi!.click the cover to order louie’s leadership legacy book..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  forgiveness  fundamentals in leadership  healthy culture  honesty  ken blanchard  leadership  people process differently  relationships  respect  transparency  trust  truth  uncategorized tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  #toughlessons  healthy cultures 5 comments.life interrupted.june 26  2017 january 10  2017 by danisedistasi.today was the first day i was able to wrap my arms around louie and give him a huge bear hug. it was three weeks ago that i had an accident and our lives quickly changed. and in celebrating my ability to hug him and receive an under the neck snuggle from him  i thought it fitting to resume our blog after an unintentionally extended vacation..december 18  2016  was filled with great anticipation. it was one week before christmas  and the distasi family was planning to gather at my house to celebrate christmas. everything was set; the massive amounts of food  the decorations  gifts  and music. it was to be a celebration to top all the ones we had celebrated so far as a family..louie and i took our usual stroll early that morning. two days before  there had been a late evening ice storm  but this particular morning seemed okay as far as icy pavement was concerned. still  i was cautious and walked in the grass as much as possible..an elderly neighbor has a very long driveway  and louie and i had been taking her daily newspaper to her so she would not have to venture out and lean over to pick it up. as soon as i stepped on the driveway  my feet flew up in the air  and i landed on my left hip. i lost control of louie  and it took me a few moments to catch my breath. i couldn’t see louie  and panic was about to set in. his normal reaction when something startles him is to run away. and seeing his mama flying through the air had to have been startling..i forced myself to turn as far to the left as i could. there louie sat  close behind my left shoulder. i reached around to draw him close to me. as he tucked his head under my arm  i felt his shaking and heard him whimper. to hear him cry broke my heart  and my tears started to flow uncontrollably. i knew i could not move—and whatever would take place from that moment forward  it would be a long journey. louie chose to stay by me as the faithful friend that he is..a neighbor pulled up with his phone in hand  already calling 911  and i called my friend and neighbor cindy to pick up louie. i called my daughter  marisa  and the network of community  family  and friends jumped into action. everyone’s life was interrupted on december 18  2016..after a jarring ambulance ride  surgery to repair a femur that was fractured in two places  a total hip replacement  five days in the hospital  and physical therapy  i was released to marisa and matt’s home for respite care and to celebrate christmas with the two cutest nurses on the face of the earth. louie had been well taken care of by my wonderful neighbors who had walked him  let him stay in their homes  taken him to daycare to play  and given him more love than he could imagine..life interrupted has taught louie and me a few things:.we appreciate life and the little things: although that seems so cliché  it was the small steps of accomplishment that filled me with joy. every day  i set new goals to accomplish—goals i never would have dreamed to set before. for instance  i learned to get out of bed  to go to the bathroom  and to take my meds without having to wake my daughter to help me. and to carry a cup of coffee in the morning to enjoy my quiet time. mea and evi helped me do things as they watched me improve. christmas had a deeper meaning this year with sincere thankfulness  love  and joy!.you really do know who your friends are: so many people dropped everything to help. it was a terrible strain on marisa and matt as they took care of me. so many friends offered to grocery shop  run errands  and stay with me when i finally came home. my sisters and cousin packed their clothes and took turns staying overnight. my brothers were calling  visiting  and bringing food. the neighbors who took care of louie were such godsends. many people could not help because of logistics  but they checked in and prayed..you have to move out of your comfort zone: this was a tough one for louie and me. i had to let people help me. what a humbling position to be in; i was helpless. i have never stayed in a hospital other than to give birth. i don’t take any medicines  and i have never fractured a single bone. the outpouring of love and encouragement has been overwhelming. louie had to be comfortable with people coming and going in and out of our home and driving him to and from daycare. but we both pressed on through pain  frustration  fear  and being uncomfortable. it was difficult  but i believe we made it past the hardest part of this process. there’s still much more healing to take place and there will always be a next move out of our comfort zone. i have no doubt we’ll press through that too..some things just do not matter: the superficiality of the holidays clashed with the richness of genuine  loving relationships. there can be no comparison of the things that are bought with the things that are sought  caught  and taught. the characteristics of love  joy  and peace are important for us to live and pass on to others. it takes effort  but it is worth the time and effort. i am a better person because of the love  joy  and peace that others shared with me this season..2017 is going to be a great year of love and strength. louie is a better dog because he chose faithfulness over running away. he trusted and allowed others into his world to help us! we are closer because of these last few weeks. thank you to so many for being in my life and for your prayers and support!.click here to sign up for louie’s email list..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  courage  fundamentals in leadership  healthy culture  leadership  lifelong relationships  relationships  respect  transparency  trust  truth  uncategorized tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  #louiesleadershiplessons  #toughlessons  danise distasi  distasi advisors  faith  healthy relationships  trust 6 comments.has leadership gone to the dogs?.november 28  2016 november 29  2016 by danisedistasi.the subject line might offend louie. in fact  it might offend you as well. but let’s face it—in the heat of the recent political battle  many of us are shaking our heads while trying to understand what just happened. one thing i do know is that disrespect for people with differing opinions is at an all-time high..the rude rhetoric on all sides of the political spectrum gave me pause and made me think of louie and some of his not-so-friendly foes. i am convinced that if people were to act the way our pets do  we would all get along better. for example  sometimes louie might see a dog that challenges him. the two will snarl and growl and perhaps even bark at each other. however  the minute we walk side by side with the dog and its owner  they seem to get along. there is something about being intentional and walking alongside someone you have a disagreement with..louie has done this with my niece’s dog  buddy. those two little boys will scrunch their noses  curl their lips  show their teeth  stand their hair up  and bark in such a high pitch that people turn their heads with a look of concern. andrea laughs  assuring everyone in sight that the dogs are actually cousins and are fine with each other. it sure doesn’t seem like it when they are facing one another. however  as soon as we start walking  they are fine together..louie also behaves this way with rambunctious claire  his other cousin noli  his neighbor snickers  and a new boxer in the community named socks. what is it about being side by side with their supposed nemesis? i think there are several things:.it is less threatening..they are on equal ground..they see the same vision of what lies ahead..they walk with the same pace..it is easier to carry the other’s burden. (okay  this one relates to humans  not louie.).what if some of our leaders were intentional about walking side by side instead of duking it out? i am reminded of an article i wrote in 2005 when i worked with ken blanchard titled “leading with your heart takes humility.” although it was written over eleven years ago  the premise holds true today: humility is the key to excelling in leadership. and servant leaders are humble enough to walk beside someone they disagree with..i won’t share the full article here (you can find it at this link)  but here are some of the highlights:.something is glaringly missing from leadership today. sadly  many leadership programs are missing just one key ingredient: the heart. not just the heart of the issue or the heart of the matter—the heart of the people..what gets in your way? what truly is your motive for being a leader or wanting to lead others? is it for selfish gain or to better others?.many times  our ego gets in the way and what bubbles up out of our hearts are things like pride  selfishness  and even fear..how can you push past what holds you back? in getting past the barriers  is the challenge as a leader to balance confidence with humility to fight ego issues? ken blanchard often uses the quote  “humility is not thinking less of yourself. it’s thinking of yourself less.” every time you make a leadership decision  are you thinking of yourself or others?.confidence does not come from being in a dominant position and leading by intimidation. doing this will cause you to lose respect from others  and any talk about values or integrity will be ignored. humility  however  is not something they teach us in business schools. it is a character trait that is honed over time with truth and love..our businesses  organizations  and families are hungry for leadership coupled with humility. it takes commitment to make the necessary changes to have a healthy culture and humble leaders..perhaps our world could learn a lesson from louie about being intentional and walking side by side with others rather than snarling at them. while louie doesn’t understand humility  his actions speak louder than his woof. he is more than willing to walk alongside others. as i watch his actions  i am convinced that we humans have much to learn from our dogs..louie’s newest revision is now available. click on the book to order..click

his face let me know he was not pleased. at all..“louie ” i said sternly as i tried to squeeze his 40 pounds of muscle where it didn’t want to go. “this is only for two hours  if that. surely you can oblige me.”.i sat back and stared at him  exasperated. for the last few halloweens  i’ve donned a cruella de vil look and spent the evening with my grandchildren. this year i thought it would be fun to take louie along in a dalmatian outfit. except there were no dalmatian costumes for dogs. the closest thing i could find was a child’s costume for a spotted cow..i had imagined how it would turn out. louie might not share my enthusiasm for this creative costume. but he’d forget all about it when he set eyes on my granddaughters  evi and mea. he’d jump out of the car and happily trot with them along the street  greeting other children  trying to get a peek into their candy loot. i just knew louie would have more fun than he could imagine if he could just push through wearing a silly cow outfit and look as much like a dalmatian as he could..i also imagined it would make a great blog lesson: all about pressing through uncomfortable situations to enjoy the outcome. sounds good  right?.being someone we’re not.but none of that happened. yes  lou was happy to see evi and mea. he did enjoy it when other children came up to love on him. but he hated his costume and was mad at me the entire time. he wouldn’t even pose for a picture  and believe me  that’s not like him..i finally took the costume off and let him be louie..too often we find ourselves being something we don’t want to be. maybe it’s of our own doing — because we think we need to fit in  and it requires being someone “different.” but often it’s because someone else expects us to be different than what we are..maybe it’s a negative thing: a boss requires us to be something based on their own insecurities. or maybe it’s positive: a leader sees potential in us that we don’t see or can even imagine  and they want to coach us to be better..no matter the reason  we resist because it is uncomfortable to be something we are not. we don’t want to don a costume and fake it..can’t make anyone change.it’s tough to balance being authentic and at the same time develop beyond mediocrity toward excellence. it can feel like donning a facade and “faking it till we make it.” what should leaders do to help folks grow?.if you’re in a position of leadership  you can suggest someone continue to develop. you can provide tools  mentoring  and ongoing training. but you can’t make them be something they don’t want to be. each person is responsible for taking that first step to wanting to make significant changes in their lives..still  there are ways to influence those in whom you see potential. for example:.watch to see whether the person shows an eagerness to learn and grow  i.e.  reading books and asking for help..ask them where do they see themselves going? what is their end goal?.share with them what potential you see in them..be sure your expectations align with their skillset and desires..if their end goal and desires outweigh their skillset  place them on a realistic development plan and be clear about expectations..greater than they imagine.when louie and i arrived back home  he was one tired pup. he slinked upstairs to his little bed to lay down. his expression told me he was still traumatized by the costume. but as i knelt down to give him a kiss  i looked into his eyes and saw a little spark..it was a look that said  “if you are trying to make me be something different than who i am  at least make me a lion!”.and with that  he tucked his head into the fold of his front paw and fell fast asleep. no doubt  that evening he dreamt of being a lion..louie the lion…hear me

oldest granddaughter  evi  share our dog louie’s story with her younger sister  mea. though you may have heard this “tail” a time or two before  i thought you would enjoy this rendition:.“a long time ago  there was a little dog who was all alone in the woods. he was scared and afraid and felt very  very alone. it was nighttime and then daylight and then nighttime  again and again. once  he saw another little animal and thought  ‘oh  that looks like someone who could be my friend.’ but the animal was a mean cat. it hissed and clawed at the poor little dog  scratching his ear till it started to bleed. ‘my ’ said the pup. ‘i guess it doesn’t want to be my friend.’ the little dog still has a mark on his ear..“the poor little dog was sad  but he kept on going because he knew somewhere  someone would love him. he was so tired that he couldn’t keep his head up. he came to a road and a woman who was driving by saw him and picked him up. she took him to a place filled with lots of people and other dogs. the people called and called and called all sorts of places to find out if anyone owned the dog. they put up signs and waited and waited  but no one came to see the little dog. he still felt all alone..“one morning  the people put the little dog in a van and drove him far  far away. they took him to an adopt-a-pet store. there  he saw a nice lady who took him home. he was scared at first  but then the lady opened the door to her home  and two little girls were waiting for him. they hugged him and kissed his head and called him their brother. louie finally found a place he called home and two sisters who loved him very much.”.mea’s mouth dropped open as she squealed  “lou-weeeeee?”.“yep  that’s louie’s story ” evi proudly announced..i smiled as i heard the tale so poignantly shared. once again  louie’s story tugged at my heart as i thought about our little dog wandering the streets and wooded areas  not knowing where he was or where he should go. it is even sadder to think that despite the shelter’s efforts to find his family  no one came to take him home. louie was unclaimed and unloved—a very sad state  indeed..since he first came to live in my home  there has been no question that he is loved. i’ve gladly claimed him as my little pal  and he truly is a brother to evi and mea. he knows where home is. every time we take a walk  he’ll look up at me with those big  brown eyes  and i’ll ask  “do you want to go home  lou?” with a spring in his step and dogged determination  he’ll prance all the way home with little guidance from me. i have been unwavering in working through life’s tough spots to build a relationship of trust  and it has paid off in huge dividends of joy for louie and me as well as for evi  mea  and many other people whom louie has come to know and love..being unclaimed and unloved is not limited to adopted pups. many people in our lives have suffered through this emotional pain. many times  these people are close friends  teammates  bosses  or fellow board members. we never know who they are because  in today’s shallow society  we don’t take the time to learn about people’s lives. we often wonder what is wrong with individuals who act out  but in many cases  these people may be unclaimed and unloved and are looking for others they can trust. don’t be like the cat in louie’s tale and lash out at them..before passing judgment on others  take the time to learn their stories. people are fascinating  and everyone has a unique history. once you learn about someone and take the time to get to know them  you’ll see them blossom and grow. learning about others is imperative to help our team build trust and learn to walk in their strengths. be the leader who is unwavering in working through tough spots to build a relationship of trust. this effort will pay off in huge dividends of joy and—believe it or not—productivity..if you are reading this blog  i want you to know you are not unclaimed or unloved  no matter what has happened to you in your past. god is unwavering in his love for us. it is up to us to joyfully accept and receive such love..as for louie—he has taught me so much about love and determination. i am never without a lesson from this little chap. he has also opened my eyes to that fact that my sweet evi is carrying on the nonna tradition of being the “best story maker” ever.

lou!.october 12  2016 october 12  2016 by danisedistasi.louie and i went for an early morning walk. i was eager to get in some exercise ahead of a busy client day. just as we crossed the street in front of a wooded area  i heard a screeching sound  as though two cats were fighting. without hesitation  lou ran as fast as he could in the opposite direction. he didn’t look around. he didn’t stop. he just took off running. once lou was at the end of the leash  his body stopped  but his legs kept going. i had to laugh because he reminded me of the jetsons with jethro  the dog  on the treadmill..only when he felt we were at a safe distance did he turn to look back with a worried look on his face. he would have nothing to do with cats  much less getting in the middle of their fight. as we walked at our usual clipped pace  i thought  “louie is a very smart dog.” oh  if only we humans could learn to run as fast as we can when others try to pull us into arguments..conflict certainly happens with our friends or families  but it is very disruptive when it happens with our teams. it creates dissension and stagnates creativity and productivity  not to mention what it does to the cultural health of an organization..we would love to offer our assistance when two coworkers are fighting so that we can feel good about helping  yet it is not always that simple or straightforward. sometimes  it is best to run in the other direction  just as louie does..there are other times  though  we may be able to offer help. in my coaching practice  i often listen to employees or leaders vent about conflict or upsetting situations. executive coaching may appear to be different from dealing with coworkers  but i have found the following process extremely helpful:.venting – people need a place to vent. sometimes  being able to verbally process helps us let off some steam and get a clearer perspective..listening – lend an empathetic ear and listen to the person. let them know you care about their situation yet you care more about the relationship..reframing – many times when someone is upset about something  he or she may not always see a different perspective of the situation. you could help that person by asking questions such as  what if the other person were challenging you with a different intent than what you assume? what is your responsibility in the situation? could it be that the other person did not intend to upset you? reframe the situation and help them to see a different perspective..envisioning – envisioning will help them to see what it would look like if they were sitting across the table from the person they are in conflict with  and talking one-on-one. this is very helpful for the person to visualize a tough conversation before he or she actually does. again  it gives them an entirely different perspective..sometimes louie’s method is actually the best. there are many times when it is not worth getting in the middle of two people who are fighting. no matter what you try to do to help  you might find that it will backfire on you..before you take that step in helping people resolve a conflict  you need to make sure that they are willing to work at it and to understand that the end goal is to mend the relationship. some people have no intentions of reconciling  and it makes it tough to work with them. the catfight will revolve around who was right and who was wrong—and there will be no resolution to the conflict..louie does the first two steps very well. he lets me talk things out and listens intently  with those big  brown  soulful eyes. then with a sweet content look on his face  he yawns and moves on. that’s a signal to me it’s time to get over whatever it was that upset me and to deal with the situation. thanks  lou  for such wisdom!.click the image for information on how to order louie’s leadership lessons.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  conflict  forgiveness

unique leadership model.september 17  2016 september 16  2016 by danisedistasi.we hope you enjoyed your summer. in celebration of the 3rd anniversary of louie’s adoption  we decided to to do an extended blog  introducing our louie leadership model..our story began three years ago in the rolling hills of boyd county  kentucky—a place i never knew existed. it’s your typical love story: boy meets girl  boy woos girl with his charming ways and big brown eyes  girl is swept off her feet  and they fall in love and live happily ever after. except in this story  the boy is an adopted puppy named louie..although i have a tremendous amount of leadership experience  i never truly understood leadership until i met this little guy..our blog  and my soon-to-be-released third book  louie’s leadership lessons  are compilations of time-tested leadership models  heart-warming stories of courage and love  and techniques for overcoming common issues such as pride  fear  and doubt—all illustrated by eye-opening experiences with my rescue dog. the time i spent with him and his trainer was life changing..this extended blog is the introduction to our new book and contains nuggets of wisdom i’ve learned over the decades about leadership and the gift of relationships with a fresh perspective renewed by louie’s point of view..i have distilled all louie has taught me into a leadership model that is easy to remember and easy to follow. when you have a leadership dilemma  ask yourself  “what would louie do?” the answer is in his name: louie..love.louie was either lost or abandoned in kentucky and made his way to cincinnati  where i live  through a number of shelters. although i love dogs  i had decided not to get another one for many reasons—that is  until i just happened to stop by petsmart while they were conducting an adopt-a-pet weekend and encountered this abandoned mutt with big brown. i tossed my concerns aside  brought him home  and named him louie distasi. i soon discovered that louie had brought a lot of emotional baggage to the relationship. he demonstrated behaviors that deeply concerned me  and i engaged a dog trainer to help address them. i quickly realized i needed training as much as louie did  if not more so..i’m not afraid of tough lessons  and i’m always looking for ways to improve my leadership skills. but working with louie was challenging. the bottom line was that louie needed acceptance  consistency  discipline  and—above all—unconditional love. i wasn’t sure i was equipped to provide all that..when i first met louie  he was very sweet and subdued in his crate. several hours after we arrived home  he became much more active. i loved louie when he was a good little dog  but i didn’t love him so much when he started to act out and behaved badly when people came to the door  etc. it was a struggle  and i had to make a choice to love him. i decided to commit to loving this abandoned pup  in spite of his baggage..employees can be like louie. they bring a lot of baggage to the job and may be hard to love at times. one of the most critical needs for any human being is the need to feel loved. all of us have this innate desire  yet it is one of the most difficult to fulfill. c. s. lewis said it best:.“to be loved but not known is comforting but superficial. to be known and not loved is our greatest fear. but to be fully known and truly loved is  well  a lot like being loved by god. it is what we need more than anything. it liberates us from pretense  humbles us out of our self-righteousness  and fortifies us for any difficulty life can throw at us.”.love is not merely a warm fuzzy feeling; love in action is the aspect that is important in leadership. when i mention the word “love” in the workplace  i receive a tremendous amount of pushback. people say  “don’t bring it up; you’ll have hr issues.” i question whether people understand what love really means..while employees can be hard to love at times (maybe most of the time)  it is still your choice to love or be indifferent toward them. let’s look at the characteristics of leaders who love:.they are patient..they are kind..they honor other people..they are honest..they are protective..they are trustworthy..they are always hopeful..they persevere through difficult situations..they are other seeking and other serving..they manage their emotions well..of course  there are also things that they are not:.they aren’t envious..they aren’t boastful..they aren’t prideful..they don’t keep records of wrongs..the characteristics of loving leaders are those that leaders should display when they are working with their people—baggage and all. that’s what love in action looks like..servant leaders are those who display the characteristics above. they are humble enough to serve and strong enough to lead..objectives and goals.the next thing i learned in the course of training louie was that  as a leader  i needed clear objectives and plans for how to achieve them. this is true with our teams at work  as well. objectives must be clear and specific. they have to be trackable. they have to be relevant. they have to be attainable and motivating..i engaged a trainer who taught me that my first goal in this journey with louie was to establish my role as leader. yep—i actually had to learn how to be louie’s alpha. i wrongly assumed he would know i was in charge because i’m bigger than him  i own the house  i pay for the meals. assuming is a mistake many leaders make. throughout our blog  you’ll read the importance of objectives and goals with each lesson i learned through louie..understanding.another lesson i learned was to truly understand that louie had “stuff” in his background. fear and anxiety issues were at the top of the list. these may have come from abandonment or abuse—it’s hard to say. but it is not unlike everyone we meet  whether he or she is on our team  or just a person whose path we crossed in the grocery store. every human being needs to feel loved and valued. it is our innermost need  and it was this little dog’s need as well. he had never had a sense of being valued in his life  and he needed to know that someone cared about him. i had to understand louie’s struggles to love him  which would enable me to set clear objectives and goals for our journey together. i needed to understand louie’s issues. it wasn’t easy to get past some of them. they were real and profound..as leaders  we need to take the time to understand our people. we need to realize that there’s always something about a person’s circumstances that we don’t know  and before we judge people  we need to try to understand them..when you run into an issue with someone and your first inclination is to become upset  try the paws method to help you analyze the situation before doing something you may regret:.pause…breathe! allow oxygen to get to your brain..ask the person questions: “what’s going on?” “can you tell me more?” “help me understand.” “is everything ok?” ask yourself questions: “why does this aggravate me?”.use wisdom. choose your words wisely. i would much rather have people feel uncomfortable waiting for me to find the right words than i ever would with words that could be hurtful..seek to understand. once you pause  ask questions  and choose your words wisely  you will naturally seek to understand. remember  everyone has “stuff” in his or her backgrounds. and so do you!.as leaders  we need to make an effort to understand. take time to understand your people and avoid making assumptions. throughout this blog  there are many lessons relating to how i learned to understand louie  who could not verbally communicate with me. these lessons will help you understand how others communicate and process ideas differently than you do—and that’s ok..investment.i then learned to invest my time and talent into developing louie. we should ask ourselves  “how much time do we invest in our teams? our families? our friends?” take the time to get to know people and invest in them..this picture breaks my heart. this is louie the first night he came home with me. he curled up in the corner  scared and alone. i put a pillow next to him to provide some comfort. louie now sleeps in a very open bed in my bedroom because he feels safe with me  and i with him. i chose to invest a tremendous amount of time in louie so that he could learn to trust and love me. it took time. everything takes time. you cannot go wrong by investing your time getting to know people. take them out to lunch. ask them questions. this point relates back to understanding. it links to feeling valued  and it relates to feeling loved. take time to gather information. you never know what you can uncover when you give your time..there are many suggestions for  and examples of  investing in others throughout our blog. get to know people  spend time with them  share your talents and your skill set; put effort into your relationships with people because you want to give without receiving anything in return. i can guarantee that if you are a leader  and you do this  your team will be more productive  creative  and effective. it is the foundation for a healthy culture. invest your time..empowerment.the last step in my leadership training with louie was to empower him. empowering your team is essential  but it’s not simply letting people do whatever they want to do. empowering is taking the time to love them and establishing clear objectives and goals. it is understanding them  and investing in them. once you do these things  your people will be empowered to use their gifts and talents to do their jobs; and in doing so  you empower them to be the people god created them to be—not who you think they should be. they will be loved and valued..louie is an entirely different dog today because i love him. i took the time to set up a development plan and was clear about objectives and goals for him to be a good  healthy dog and for us to enjoy a relationship together. i had to understand his needs. i had to understand his background. i had to figure out what was going on with him. i invested time  my skill set  and other people’s skill sets to help develop him. he is empowered to be a fun-loving  free little dog..my work with louie is not unlike leading our teams. transformation occurs when we apply the louie leadership model: love  objectives  understanding  investment  and empowerment  as well as the paws model: pause  ask  wisdom  and seek. throughout louie’s leadership lessons  you will see more examples of these two models wrapped in stories of love  struggles  and immense joy..while it brings me great pleasure to know that louie is a transformed dog  i am the one who has been profoundly changed into a better leader because of the lessons i’ve learned from my experiences with him. we look forward to continuing our journey with you through our

can hear him all the way down the street. people will turn and wait as louie’s whines get louder and his tail wags faster. he’ll run towards the person or one of his furry friends. he excitedly greets them and then boom! he’s on to the next friend..people know he’s going to do that to them. they watch him run and hear his excitement and after a few doggie sniffs he quickly moves on. my neighbors fully expect him to behave this way because they’ve witnessed this so many times. and now it’s the talk of the neighborhood…how snooty little louie distasi can be..i make excuses and justify his behavior by saying things like  “he’s very focused on his walk ” or “don’t take it personal  he’s anxious to keep moving.” it is obvious his reputation clearly precedes him as we walk through the neighborhood..this behavior has me ponder the importance of our reputations. it is much harder to build a reputation than to destroy it. building a good reputation requires patience  solid values  intentionality and time. destroying a good reputation only requires a single moment’s mistake. to build a good reputation  be a person who is worthy of one. demonstrate the characteristics you want others to associate with you..i had the honor and pleasure to work with ken blanchard in early 2000. during a lead like jesus workshop in 2001  he shared a memorable exercise that left an indelible imprint on my mind and heart..ken told a story about swedish chemist alfred bernhard nobel  who invented dynamite in 1866 and became rich. nobel was as interested in drama and poetry as he was in chemistry and physics  but it was in the sciences that he made his fame  and by the time of his death he held more than 350 patents and controlled factories and labs in 20 countries..when alfred nobel’s brother died a newspaper mistakenly published an obituary of alfred that emphasized the fact that he had invented things that blew up and killed people. nobel  not wanting to be remembered in that way  pledged his wealth toward the betterment of humanity. in his will he directed the establishment of a foundation to award annual prizes for achievement in chemistry  physics  literature  and efforts toward international peace  which is known as the nobel prize. this award is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the world and includes a cash prize of nearly one million dollars..ken asked  “what do you want your obituary to say about you?” he had the participants write out their thoughts. and then he asked  “what do you have to do today to be the person you want to be remembered as?”.that exercise had a profound effect on me then and still does today. i don’t want to be gone and people have to drum up something about me being a compassionate and deeply caring person. i commit to living out those characteristics today..i encourage you to do the exercise ken has had so many people around the world engage in doing: write your own obituary. take time to figure out how you want to be remembered and then commit to being that person today!.as for louie  it may be too late. it seems his reputation precedes him and not in a good way. we’ll have to continue to work on his relational skills and how he engages with others. stay tuned!.**louie and i hope you and your family will join us in remembering the countless men and women who have fought for our country. give thanks for those who have given their lives and always thank a veteran and those currently serving!**.click the image for information on how to order louie’s leadership lessons.email

uh  you lookin’ at me?”.she then stands a little taller and looks down at him as if to say  “what are you talking about? you’re lookin’ at me!” he puffs his chest out and she pushes her nose at him  and before you know it they are huffing and puffing and challenging one another. with a slight tug on his leash and my usual command to “leave it ” we continue on our walk..now these two have had great interactions before  and  based on louie’s body language and tone of voice  he’s not aggressively challenging her. but i find it interesting that his bad behavior provokes her bad behavior and  if allowed  it may escalate to a more serious challenge..i noticed this too with his little buddy  mac. louie typically ignores him  but when mac is unusually “active ” louie seems to chime right in and become an obnoxious pup by playing rough (with me  not another dog) or ignoring me when it is time to settle down..our work teams are very similar. although a smile or a word of affirmation from a coworker can spread good cheer in the workplace  bad behavior and rudeness are also contagious. being rude or impolite to your coworkers can lead them to behave the same way  negatively affecting our culture and productivity..as leaders  rudeness should not be tolerated in our work or homes. while there may be many reasons for someone to be in a bad mood and react negatively  it is our responsibility as leaders to demonstrate that even under unpleasant circumstances it is never okay to be rude and disrespectful. so what are we to do?.it seems the “leave it” command works well for louie  and it works well for me  too. “leave it” doesn’t mean to ignore the situation and hope it goes away. it simply means to not dwell on it and let the emotion subside. oswald chambers  an early twentieth-century scottish theologian and teacher  said over a century ago  “there is always at least one more fact  which we know nothing about  in every person’s situation.”.this is a good time to revisit the paws method. when someone is rude and your first inclination is to become upset and respond rudely  try this method to help you analyze the situation before doing something you may regret:.pause—breathe! allow oxygen to get to your brain. you may need to walk away for a bit and then revisit the situation. there is power in the pause. when we pause before speaking  we gain time to process our thoughts..ask questions: “what’s going on?” “can you tell me more?” “can you help me understand?” “is everything okay?” ask yourself these things: is there something else going on in this person’s life? what’s going on with me? why does this aggravate me? reflect on your answers before you speak..wisdom: choose your words wisely. i would much rather have people feel uncomfortable waiting for me to find the right words than allowing myself to get sucked into poor behavior. carefully consider the words you are about to say. if they are not life-giving  do not say them. nothing good comes from useless  mindless words..seek to understand: once you pause  ask questions  and choose your words wisely  you will naturally seek to understand. remember  everyone has “stuff” in his or her backgrounds. and so do you!.there is no reason to tolerate rudeness in our workplace  and studies have shown that bad behavior begets bad behavior. we have a responsibility as leaders to stop that behavior in order to maintain or restore a healthy culture..as for louie and his beautiful tall cool blonde friend  i think they may secretly like each other. i may have to help him a bit with showing girls his interest. so far he’s not scoring any points  but i still love him..my bad little dog  talented as he may be. he actually pulled a towel out of the laundry basket and somehow wrapped himself in it and settled in for a nap!.click here to sign up for louie’s emails.through lessons learned from a well-loved rescue pup  a leadership model emerges that makes the connection to relationships  revealing the small ways leaders can empower their teams every day..click the image for information on how to order louie’s leadership lessons.louie’s leadership lessons are lovingly fed by….categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  ending well  fear and pride  forgiveness  fundamentals in leadership  gossip  healthy culture  honesty  leadership  relationships  respect  the louie model  transparency  trust  truth tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  distasi advisors  healthy cultures  healthy relationships  love  realational leadership leave a comment.will you please stop whining.february 6  2017 february 7  2017 by danisedistasi.a passing thought drifted through my mind the other day: i will miss all the love and attention i have received over the past few weeks. but since i would rather hear “wow  you’re doing so well” than “oh  gee  sorry you’re still struggling with your recovery ” the thought passed quickly  never to return..because i’m ready to close the chapter on my accident and subsequent surgery  my passing thought is not what the subject line is referring to. this is a blog about my persnickety pup louie and his ever-increasing need to whine. while i know he suffered trauma over the past couple of months along with me  his whining seems to have increased exponentially rather than to have subsided as i would have expected. i soon discovered his behavior has nothing to do with my injury. instead  louie is reacting to a new dog in the neighborhood..this new dog represents everything louie hates. the dog is a male  he’s bigger than lou  and he’s . . . shhhh . . . not neutered. the last issue sends louie into a tizzy even before we walk out the door. his hackles go up  and he puffs out his chest and huffs as he walks out. but then the incessant whining begins. and once he starts that  it’s tough to get him to stop..one morning as we exited the garage  we made a sharp left turn out of our driveway and hurried away from where the dog lives as quickly as a girl with a cane can manage. louie looked back  whined  and seemed disoriented. i tugged on his collar and gave a stern command  “leave it ” which he immediately obeyed  but his memory is keen  and it quickly took him back to the dark side. i was hoping he would find a new smell to distract him..thanks to zig our dog trainer  i learned a long time ago that louie whines out of fear  so i have to step up and walk with confidence. that’s tough to do considering i’m still healing  but i did the best i could. louie suspiciously eyed the cane  and then looked back at me with a face that said he was not convinced i could protect us both . . . and i didn’t blame him..as our walk settled into a more relaxed pace  i reflected on why some people  like louie  seem to whine so much. do you have a few whiners on your team? it’s easy to get frustrated and dismiss them  but there is usually something deeper going on that we may never uncover unless we take the time to do so..fear is a big issue for louie  which is why he whines. fear is a big issue for people as well and could be the reason some folks whine. i have learned to counter louie’s fear  not with my confidence but with love. love is the first step of the louie leadership model:.love is foundational to building trust and integrity for a personal or professional relationship to flourish. without love and trust  our relationships are like fragile shells that have nothing inside of them and with the slightest amount of pressure  are easily shattered. because of the love i have demonstrated for louie on a regular basis  he has learned to trust me.

now that is a really annoying bad habit that makes me realize we are back to square one. there will be no dominance of louie over me..but this is not surprising. when it takes all my energy to walk from the living room to the kitchen  disciplining a dog is not high on my list  especially since we’ve been through this before. the pressure was off of louie to behave well  and when the pressure is off  he reverts back to his old habits..that is so like us. a while ago  i wrote a blog about something i learned from my time with the ken blanchard companies about the dynamics of change. one dynamic is that when the pressure is off  we revert to our original behaviors. well  the pressure was definitely off  and louie was back to some of his old habits. we will need to spend time correcting that. but rather than lament  i reflected on what this means as far as my recent journey and getting “back to normal.”.finally being able to drive did give me a sense of life getting back to normal. getting off medication  walking better  and looking forward to some normalcy were great goals for recovery. but did i really want normalcy to be my goal?.not this time  not this year. i am going to be intentional (keeping the pressure on) about breaking past the norm to live a well-meaning life by doing the following:.pruning activities  objects  and even some relationships  all to devote precious time to what matters;.being kind in thought  word  and deed  whether people deserve it or not. i don’t mean just merely being nice (and sometimes superficial and phony)  but being authentic and loving—speaking truth in love and showing those who differ from me  or have differing viewpoints  the compassion that only comes from faith in god;.taking time to listen in order to learn—and not rushing to the next project;.being still and having plenty of margin in my life;.laughing more; and.dancing (okay  that one is normal for me  but now takes on an even more special meaning). i will take time to dance more with my grandchildren and even my adult daughter because that’s what distasi kids do. my niece sara is getting married in september  and she has promised we will dance the night away. that is my goal for 2017..be intentional about breaking past the norm. life is too short and too easily interrupted for us to stay stuck in the status quo. and you are never too old to take that first step to crashing through the “same ol’  same ol’.”.as for louie  we have some work to do. as i have been writing  he slipped into my laundry room and pulled out a dishtowel. he is so bad. i know he has a large fan base of people who love him  but this annoying little habit just makes me shake my head. i suppose being intentionally kind starts now with little louie distasi!.click the cover to order louie’s leadership legacy book..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  forgiveness  fundamentals in leadership  healthy culture  honesty  ken blanchard  leadership  people process differently  relationships  respect  transparency  trust  truth  uncategorized tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  #toughlessons  healthy cultures 5 comments.expectations vs. expectancy.december 12  2016 december 13  2016 by danisedistasi.louie  my adopted pup  and i were walking on a beautiful fall day when we saw one of his pug buddies—or so we thought. his friend sammy is a tan and black pug with a unique characteristic: his tongue protrudes ever so slightly. i recognized that the person walking him was not his owner. that’s not unusual since many of us in the community need others to walk our dogs on occasion. louie was excited to see his buddy and could hardly wait to romp and play..as we approached  i asked if the dog was sammy  because he had the same markings and same characteristic of a slightly protruding tongue. the person walking him said no. but louie quickly ran up to the sammy look-alike; it did not take him long to realize this was not his buddy  and then he became indignant as if he was mad at the pug for not being sammy..we quickly said our good-byes while louie kicked up his feet and snarled just to make sure the dog understood he was not even close to being sammy..i realized louie’s expectations for playing with his friend were unmet  and disappointment had set in quickly. based on all appearances  louie was expecting to have fun and play  but that expectation was not to be filled that day..this time of year  the majority of us have many expectations that  when unmet for whatever reason  will disappoint us. people have a hard time moving on from such setbacks. i think these disappointments occur because we’ve set ourselves up for failure when we box up our expectations in the hopes that they will be fulfilled..instead  what if we had a spirit of expectancy? you may wonder what the difference is between having expectations and having a spirit of expectancy. a spirit of expectancy is what very young children usually possess. they have the mindset that something wonderful is about to happen  but with no expectation of specifics. while they may wish for something on their christmas list  it is their heart of expectancy that is truly magical. it is the hopefulness of something wonderful. for me  that may entail time with my family  but without expectation that the time meets any specific criteria—it is simply time together..another example occurred on the holiest of nights. for centuries  people expected the messiah to come amongst their midst. in this expectation  they envisioned a king  surrounded by throngs of noble men and women and trumpets blaring. because of these expectations they missed the wonder of all that took place on that quiet  serene night when the stars were brightly shining..yet only those with a spirit of expectancy  whose hearts were open to the wonder of what only the creator of the universe could put into action  witnessed the birth of the king in a simple  lowly manger..expectations for particular things and events always run the risk of disappointing us  since many times  events and what others do are out of our control. as we wind down our year  rather than focusing on the disappointments of unmet expectations  let’s look forward with a heart of expectancy and see if that doesn’t lighten our spirits with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen..while louie experienced disappointment by not having his expectations met with the look-alike sammy  it did not dampen his spirit of expectancy. he still walks out of our home with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen. something as simple as seeing a dear neighbor who pats him on the head or gives him belly rubs lends to his heart of wonder..click the image for information on how to order louie’s leadership lessons.categories balance of strong  be authentic  christmas memories  conflict  consistency  courage  fundamentals in leadership  healthy culture  leadership  relationships  resignations  transparency  trust  unmet expectations tags #danisedistasi  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  #louiesleadershiplessons  #pridegetsintheway  #toughlessons  danise distasi  distasi advisors  healthy cultures  healthy relationships  hope love  leadership 6 comments.has leadership gone to the dogs?.november 28  2016 november 29  2016 by danisedistasi.the subject line might offend louie. in fact  it might offend you as well. but let’s face it—in the heat of the recent political battle  many of us are shaking our heads while trying to understand what just happened. one thing i do know is that disrespect for people with differing opinions is at an all-time high..the rude rhetoric on all sides of the political spectrum gave me pause and made me think of louie and some of his not-so-friendly foes. i am convinced that if people were to act the way our pets do  we would all get along better. for example  sometimes louie might see a dog that challenges him. the two will snarl and growl and perhaps even bark at each other. however  the minute we walk side by side with the dog and its owner  they seem to get along. there is something about being intentional and walking alongside someone you have a disagreement with..louie has done this with my niece’s dog  buddy. those two little boys will scrunch their noses  curl their lips  show their teeth  stand their hair up  and bark in such a high pitch that people turn their heads with a look of concern. andrea laughs  assuring everyone in sight that the dogs are actually cousins and are fine with each other. it sure doesn’t seem like it when they are facing one another. however  as soon as we start walking  they are fine together..louie also behaves this way with rambunctious claire  his other cousin noli  his neighbor snickers  and a new boxer in the community named socks. what is it about being side by side with their supposed nemesis? i think there are several things:.it is less threatening..they are on equal ground..they see the same vision of what lies ahead..they walk with the same pace..it is easier to carry the other’s burden. (okay  this one relates to humans  not louie.).what if some of our leaders were intentional about walking side by side instead of duking it out? i am reminded of an article i wrote in 2005 when i worked with ken blanchard titled “leading with your heart takes humility.” although it was written over eleven years ago  the premise holds true today: humility is the key to excelling in leadership. and servant leaders are humble enough to walk beside someone they disagree with..i won’t share the full article here (you can find it at this link)  but here are some of the highlights:.something is glaringly missing from leadership today. sadly  many leadership programs are missing just one key ingredient: the heart. not just the heart of the issue or the heart of the matter—the heart of the people..what gets in your way? what truly is your motive for being a leader or wanting to lead others? is it for selfish gain or to better others?.many times  our ego gets in the way and what bubbles up out of our hearts are things like pride  selfishness  and even fear..how can you push past what holds you back? in getting past the barriers  is the challenge as a leader to balance confidence with humility to fight ego issues? ken blanchard often uses the quote  “humility is not thinking less of yourself. it’s thinking of yourself less.” every time you make a leadership decision  are you thinking of yourself or others?.confidence does not come from being in a dominant position and leading by intimidation. doing this will cause you to lose respect from others  and any talk about values or integrity will be ignored. humility  however  is not something they teach us in business schools. it is a character trait that is honed over time with truth and love..our businesses  organizations  and families are hungry for leadership coupled with humility. it takes commitment to make the necessary changes to have a healthy culture and humble leaders..perhaps our world could learn a lesson from louie about being intentional and walking side by side with others rather than snarling at them. while louie doesn’t understand humility  his actions speak louder than his woof. he is more than willing to walk alongside others. as i watch his actions  i am convinced that we humans have much to learn from our dogs..louie’s newest revision is now available. click on the book to order..click

his face let me know he was not pleased. at all..“louie ” i said sternly as i tried to squeeze his 40 pounds of muscle where it didn’t want to go. “this is only for two hours  if that. surely you can oblige me.”.i sat back and stared at him  exasperated. for the last few halloweens  i’ve donned a cruella de vil look and spent the evening with my grandchildren. this year i thought it would be fun to take louie along in a dalmatian outfit. except there were no dalmatian costumes for dogs. the closest thing i could find was a child’s costume for a spotted cow..i had imagined how it would turn out. louie might not share my enthusiasm for this creative costume. but he’d forget all about it when he set eyes on my granddaughters  evi and mea. he’d jump out of the car and happily trot with them along the street  greeting other children  trying to get a peek into their candy loot. i just knew louie would have more fun than he could imagine if he could just push through wearing a silly cow outfit and look as much like a dalmatian as he could..i also imagined it would make a great blog lesson: all about pressing through uncomfortable situations to enjoy the outcome. sounds good  right?.being someone we’re not.but none of that happened. yes  lou was happy to see evi and mea. he did enjoy it when other children came up to love on him. but he hated his costume and was mad at me the entire time. he wouldn’t even pose for a picture  and believe me  that’s not like him..i finally took the costume off and let him be louie..too often we find ourselves being something we don’t want to be. maybe it’s of our own doing — because we think we need to fit in  and it requires being someone “different.” but often it’s because someone else expects us to be different than what we are..maybe it’s a negative thing: a boss requires us to be something based on their own insecurities. or maybe it’s positive: a leader sees potential in us that we don’t see or can even imagine  and they want to coach us to be better..no matter the reason  we resist because it is uncomfortable to be something we are not. we don’t want to don a costume and fake it..can’t make anyone change.it’s tough to balance being authentic and at the same time develop beyond mediocrity toward excellence. it can feel like donning a facade and “faking it till we make it.” what should leaders do to help folks grow?.if you’re in a position of leadership  you can suggest someone continue to develop. you can provide tools  mentoring  and ongoing training. but you can’t make them be something they don’t want to be. each person is responsible for taking that first step to wanting to make significant changes in their lives..still  there are ways to influence those in whom you see potential. for example:.watch to see whether the person shows an eagerness to learn and grow  i.e.  reading books and asking for help..ask them where do they see themselves going? what is their end goal?.share with them what potential you see in them..be sure your expectations align with their skillset and desires..if their end goal and desires outweigh their skillset  place them on a realistic development plan and be clear about expectations..greater than they imagine.when louie and i arrived back home  he was one tired pup. he slinked upstairs to his little bed to lay down. his expression told me he was still traumatized by the costume. but as i knelt down to give him a kiss  i looked into his eyes and saw a little spark..it was a look that said  “if you are trying to make me be something different than who i am  at least make me a lion!”.and with that  he tucked his head into the fold of his front paw and fell fast asleep. no doubt  that evening he dreamt of being a lion..louie the lion…hear me

oldest granddaughter  evi  share our dog louie’s story with her younger sister  mea. though you may have heard this “tail” a time or two before  i thought you would enjoy this rendition:.“a long time ago  there was a little dog who was all alone in the woods. he was scared and afraid and felt very  very alone. it was nighttime and then daylight and then nighttime  again and again. once  he saw another little animal and thought  ‘oh  that looks like someone who could be my friend.’ but the animal was a mean cat. it hissed and clawed at the poor little dog  scratching his ear till it started to bleed. ‘my ’ said the pup. ‘i guess it doesn’t want to be my friend.’ the little dog still has a mark on his ear..“the poor little dog was sad  but he kept on going because he knew somewhere  someone would love him. he was so tired that he couldn’t keep his head up. he came to a road and a woman who was driving by saw him and picked him up. she took him to a place filled with lots of people and other dogs. the people called and called and called all sorts of places to find out if anyone owned the dog. they put up signs and waited and waited  but no one came to see the little dog. he still felt all alone..“one morning  the people put the little dog in a van and drove him far  far away. they took him to an adopt-a-pet store. there  he saw a nice lady who took him home. he was scared at first  but then the lady opened the door to her home  and two little girls were waiting for him. they hugged him and kissed his head and called him their brother. louie finally found a place he called home and two sisters who loved him very much.”.mea’s mouth dropped open as she squealed  “lou-weeeeee?”.“yep  that’s louie’s story ” evi proudly announced..i smiled as i heard the tale so poignantly shared. once again  louie’s story tugged at my heart as i thought about our little dog wandering the streets and wooded areas  not knowing where he was or where he should go. it is even sadder to think that despite the shelter’s efforts to find his family  no one came to take him home. louie was unclaimed and unloved—a very sad state  indeed..since he first came to live in my home  there has been no question that he is loved. i’ve gladly claimed him as my little pal  and he truly is a brother to evi and mea. he knows where home is. every time we take a walk  he’ll look up at me with those big  brown eyes  and i’ll ask  “do you want to go home  lou?” with a spring in his step and dogged determination  he’ll prance all the way home with little guidance from me. i have been unwavering in working through life’s tough spots to build a relationship of trust  and it has paid off in huge dividends of joy for louie and me as well as for evi  mea  and many other people whom louie has come to know and love..being unclaimed and unloved is not limited to adopted pups. many people in our lives have suffered through this emotional pain. many times  these people are close friends  teammates  bosses  or fellow board members. we never know who they are because  in today’s shallow society  we don’t take the time to learn about people’s lives. we often wonder what is wrong with individuals who act out  but in many cases  these people may be unclaimed and unloved and are looking for others they can trust. don’t be like the cat in louie’s tale and lash out at them..before passing judgment on others  take the time to learn their stories. people are fascinating  and everyone has a unique history. once you learn about someone and take the time to get to know them  you’ll see them blossom and grow. learning about others is imperative to help our team build trust and learn to walk in their strengths. be the leader who is unwavering in working through tough spots to build a relationship of trust. this effort will pay off in huge dividends of joy and—believe it or not—productivity..if you are reading this blog  i want you to know you are not unclaimed or unloved  no matter what has happened to you in your past. god is unwavering in his love for us. it is up to us to joyfully accept and receive such love..as for louie—he has taught me so much about love and determination. i am never without a lesson from this little chap. he has also opened my eyes to that fact that my sweet evi is carrying on the nonna tradition of being the “best story maker” ever.

model.september 17  2016 september 16  2016 by danisedistasi.we hope you enjoyed your summer. in celebration of the 3rd anniversary of louie’s adoption  we decided to to do an extended blog  introducing our louie leadership model..our story began three years ago in the rolling hills of boyd county  kentucky—a place i never knew existed. it’s your typical love story: boy meets girl  boy woos girl with his charming ways and big brown eyes  girl is swept off her feet  and they fall in love and live happily ever after. except in this story  the boy is an adopted puppy named louie..although i have a tremendous amount of leadership experience  i never truly understood leadership until i met this little guy..our blog  and my soon-to-be-released third book  louie’s leadership lessons  are compilations of time-tested leadership models  heart-warming stories of courage and love  and techniques for overcoming common issues such as pride  fear  and doubt—all illustrated by eye-opening experiences with my rescue dog. the time i spent with him and his trainer was life changing..this extended blog is the introduction to our new book and contains nuggets of wisdom i’ve learned over the decades about leadership and the gift of relationships with a fresh perspective renewed by louie’s point of view..i have distilled all louie has taught me into a leadership model that is easy to remember and easy to follow. when you have a leadership dilemma  ask yourself  “what would louie do?” the answer is in his name: louie..love.louie was either lost or abandoned in kentucky and made his way to cincinnati  where i live  through a number of shelters. although i love dogs  i had decided not to get another one for many reasons—that is  until i just happened to stop by petsmart while they were conducting an adopt-a-pet weekend and encountered this abandoned mutt with big brown. i tossed my concerns aside  brought him home  and named him louie distasi. i soon discovered that louie had brought a lot of emotional baggage to the relationship. he demonstrated behaviors that deeply concerned me  and i engaged a dog trainer to help address them. i quickly realized i needed training as much as louie did  if not more so..i’m not afraid of tough lessons  and i’m always looking for ways to improve my leadership skills. but working with louie was challenging. the bottom line was that louie needed acceptance  consistency  discipline  and—above all—unconditional love. i wasn’t sure i was equipped to provide all that..when i first met louie  he was very sweet and subdued in his crate. several hours after we arrived home  he became much more active. i loved louie when he was a good little dog  but i didn’t love him so much when he started to act out and behaved badly when people came to the door  etc. it was a struggle  and i had to make a choice to love him. i decided to commit to loving this abandoned pup  in spite of his baggage..employees can be like louie. they bring a lot of baggage to the job and may be hard to love at times. one of the most critical needs for any human being is the need to feel loved. all of us have this innate desire  yet it is one of the most difficult to fulfill. c. s. lewis said it best:.“to be loved but not known is comforting but superficial. to be known and not loved is our greatest fear. but to be fully known and truly loved is  well  a lot like being loved by god. it is what we need more than anything. it liberates us from pretense  humbles us out of our self-righteousness  and fortifies us for any difficulty life can throw at us.”.love is not merely a warm fuzzy feeling; love in action is the aspect that is important in leadership. when i mention the word “love” in the workplace  i receive a tremendous amount of pushback. people say  “don’t bring it up; you’ll have hr issues.” i question whether people understand what love really means..while employees can be hard to love at times (maybe most of the time)  it is still your choice to love or be indifferent toward them. let’s look at the characteristics of leaders who love:.they are patient..they are kind..they honor other people..they are honest..they are protective..they are trustworthy..they are always hopeful..they persevere through difficult situations..they are other seeking and other serving..they manage their emotions well..of course  there are also things that they are not:.they aren’t envious..they aren’t boastful..they aren’t prideful..they don’t keep records of wrongs..the characteristics of loving leaders are those that leaders should display when they are working with their people—baggage and all. that’s what love in action looks like..servant leaders are those who display the characteristics above. they are humble enough to serve and strong enough to lead..objectives and goals.the next thing i learned in the course of training louie was that  as a leader  i needed clear objectives and plans for how to achieve them. this is true with our teams at work  as well. objectives must be clear and specific. they have to be trackable. they have to be relevant. they have to be attainable and motivating..i engaged a trainer who taught me that my first goal in this journey with louie was to establish my role as leader. yep—i actually had to learn how to be louie’s alpha. i wrongly assumed he would know i was in charge because i’m bigger than him  i own the house  i pay for the meals. assuming is a mistake many leaders make. throughout our blog  you’ll read the importance of objectives and goals with each lesson i learned through louie..understanding.another lesson i learned was to truly understand that louie had “stuff” in his background. fear and anxiety issues were at the top of the list. these may have come from abandonment or abuse—it’s hard to say. but it is not unlike everyone we meet  whether he or she is on our team  or just a person whose path we crossed in the grocery store. every human being needs to feel loved and valued. it is our innermost need  and it was this little dog’s need as well. he had never had a sense of being valued in his life  and he needed to know that someone cared about him. i had to understand louie’s struggles to love him  which would enable me to set clear objectives and goals for our journey together. i needed to understand louie’s issues. it wasn’t easy to get past some of them. they were real and profound..as leaders  we need to take the time to understand our people. we need to realize that there’s always something about a person’s circumstances that we don’t know  and before we judge people  we need to try to understand them..when you run into an issue with someone and your first inclination is to become upset  try the paws method to help you analyze the situation before doing something you may regret:.pause…breathe! allow oxygen to get to your brain..ask the person questions: “what’s going on?” “can you tell me more?” “help me understand.” “is everything ok?” ask yourself questions: “why does this aggravate me?”.use wisdom. choose your words wisely. i would much rather have people feel uncomfortable waiting for me to find the right words than i ever would with words that could be hurtful..seek to understand. once you pause  ask questions  and choose your words wisely  you will naturally seek to understand. remember  everyone has “stuff” in his or her backgrounds. and so do you!.as leaders  we need to make an effort to understand. take time to understand your people and avoid making assumptions. throughout this blog  there are many lessons relating to how i learned to understand louie  who could not verbally communicate with me. these lessons will help you understand how others communicate and process ideas differently than you do—and that’s ok..investment.i then learned to invest my time and talent into developing louie. we should ask ourselves  “how much time do we invest in our teams? our families? our friends?” take the time to get to know people and invest in them..this picture breaks my heart. this is louie the first night he came home with me. he curled up in the corner  scared and alone. i put a pillow next to him to provide some comfort. louie now sleeps in a very open bed in my bedroom because he feels safe with me  and i with him. i chose to invest a tremendous amount of time in louie so that he could learn to trust and love me. it took time. everything takes time. you cannot go wrong by investing your time getting to know people. take them out to lunch. ask them questions. this point relates back to understanding. it links to feeling valued  and it relates to feeling loved. take time to gather information. you never know what you can uncover when you give your time..there are many suggestions for  and examples of  investing in others throughout our blog. get to know people  spend time with them  share your talents and your skill set; put effort into your relationships with people because you want to give without receiving anything in return. i can guarantee that if you are a leader  and you do this  your team will be more productive  creative  and effective. it is the foundation for a healthy culture. invest your time..empowerment.the last step in my leadership training with louie was to empower him. empowering your team is essential  but it’s not simply letting people do whatever they want to do. empowering is taking the time to love them and establishing clear objectives and goals. it is understanding them  and investing in them. once you do these things  your people will be empowered to use their gifts and talents to do their jobs; and in doing so  you empower them to be the people god created them to be—not who you think they should be. they will be loved and valued..louie is an entirely different dog today because i love him. i took the time to set up a development plan and was clear about objectives and goals for him to be a good  healthy dog and for us to enjoy a relationship together. i had to understand his needs. i had to understand his background. i had to figure out what was going on with him. i invested time  my skill set  and other people’s skill sets to help develop him. he is empowered to be a fun-loving  free little dog..my work with louie is not unlike leading our teams. transformation occurs when we apply the louie leadership model: love  objectives  understanding  investment  and empowerment  as well as the paws model: pause  ask  wisdom  and seek. throughout louie’s leadership lessons  you will see more examples of these two models wrapped in stories of love  struggles  and immense joy..while it brings me great pleasure to know that louie is a transformed dog  i am the one who has been profoundly changed into a better leader because of the lessons i’ve learned from my experiences with him. we look forward to continuing our journey with you through our

twin of louie. she is a corgi-beagle mix  and she even has the same facial markings as louie. she is a bit smaller than louie  and her name is peanut..there was a noticeable difference  however  in the size of their mouths. like her name  she was a peanut  and her mouth was tiny compared to louie’s very big mouth. louie’s mouth can do many things: bark  growl  show his teeth  eat  and mouth to pull and play. louie provides “love taps” by poking his mouth against your hand when he is excited to see you. his mouth is conveniently attached to his nose which he uses to poke and prod. they work together to borough in the ground and pull lumps of grass to get to a mole..although louie’s large mouth is actually harmless  he could do a lot of damage with it. this is not unlike ourselves. our mouths  specifically our tongues  may seem harmless  but oh the damage they can do and usually  unnecessarily..i love what the bible teaches us about the tongue. “a bit in the mouth of a horse controls the whole horse. a small rudder on a huge ship in the hands of a skilled captain sets a course in the face of the strongest winds. a word out of your mouth may seem of no account  but it can accomplish nearly anything—or destroy it! it only takes a spark  remember  to set off a forest fire. a careless or wrongly placed word out of your mouth can do that. by our speech we can ruin the world  turn harmony to chaos  throw mud on a reputation  send the whole world up in smoke and go up in smoke with it…” and “you can tame a tiger  but you can’t tame a tongue—it’s never been done.”.we have the power to use our words to give life or to bring death to our relationships. hurtful words can be used in slander  gossip  arguing  criticizing  complaining  distasteful language  boasting  and lying. and the damage can be irreparable. as we read that list  we shake our heads for we clearly know others who do these things. yet  there’s a small voice within us that whispers  “could this be me?”.i believe we are all guilty of some or all of these things. for the sake of brevity  let’s focus on the first two: gossip and slander. by definition  gossip is sharing personal or sensational facts about others; sharing private information with those who are not part of the problem or solution. slander is using words  tonal patterns or facial expressions to deliberately damage someone else’s reputation with information that does not need to be shared..we all do this either subtly or with as much gusto as possible  and perhaps we are not aware of the damage we are doing. i am most grieved by those who teach and preach against gossip and yet do so under the guise of caring for the person they are talking about  or worse  having the need to play the victim role and share how unfair someone treated them..it takes intentionality to not step foot on the slippery slope of gossip and slander. it is not easy  but i am committing to these steps  thanks to louie’s inspiration:.paws.pause: there is power in the pause. when we pause before speaking  we gain time to process our thoughts. i’d rather make people uncomfortable with my pause than with my words. i’ve never regretted my pauses  but too many times  i have regretted my words..ask: ask yourself these things: what’s going on with me? why do i have this need to share this? would i want this person sharing information about me? would i share this if the other person were in front of me? reflect on your answers before you speak..wisdom: choose your words wisely. when we speak from a place of wisdom  people are more inclined to listen. carefully consider the words you are about to say. if they are not life-giving  do not say them. nothing good comes from useless  mindless words..stop and seek to understand: stop gossiping for one day. when we want to lose weight  we log our food to keep track of what we are putting into our bodies. take a day this week to log how many times you talk about someone else. that may make you more aware of how easily gossip has seeped into your life. then ask a friend to hold you accountable when you are together  and commit to not talking about others. seek to understand the other person before casting judgement..through my relationship with louie  i have learned a tremendous amount about my relationships with humans. with the size of his mouth  he could take a chunk out of someone  but he clearly chooses not to (up to this point). in that same way  i want nothing to stand in my way with those who are in my life  even those with whom i interact for a short time. i am going to stamp out gossip and slander in my life using the paws method. i hope you will join me..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  conflict

took a long  quick-paced walk. as we headed into the homestretch  we slowed  and louie stopped to investigate a grassy area. suddenly he took three hops and then pounced on a tunnel that clearly contained a live mole running for its life just a few inches underground..louie was unstoppable. with his long snout he dug  snorted  clawed  and tore away chunks of grass. i was amazed as i watched him and could only imagine the mole’s heart racing as it made its way under a fence to safety. louie made it clear that no mole is safe in his neighborhood. and with that he turned  puffed out his chest  and pranced away..i’ve never seen louie hop  but the bounce in his step and the sheer determination in his hot pursuit of the mole made me smile. rather than walk away in defeat  he strutted off knowing he did exactly what he was created to do—hunt moles..as we walked i wondered about being created for a purpose. louie instinctively knows to track a scent  and nothing deters him once he is on one. but what about you as a leader or those you lead? are you doing what you were created to do? are you providing the environment for your direct reports to do what they’ve been created to do? very few people do  and you immediately recognize those who are: the speaker who captivates you till the end  the author who unlocks a truth deep within  the woodworker who takes your breath away with his talent  the businesswoman who builds a relationship while providing the exact solution needed  and the teacher who watches another class graduate..yet so many times people are placed in roles because a function needs to be filled. the frustration builds when a particular position is not at all what that person was designed to do. for instance  a company just lost its vice president of sales. the organization already has a successful account manager  and due to budget and time constraints  management decides to promote this employee into the role. it is unlikely that the account manager will be successful because he or she may not be a hunter or is uncomfortable going after a deal. most account managers prefer to nurture accounts  follow a process  and assist customers with their experience. as a result  sales will suffer and the new vice president  once thriving and successful  will suffer as well..once we recognize that we aren’t doing what we were created to do  we may feel a prolonged level of dissatisfaction. that’s when it is time to take stock and make changes:.listen to your gut. we’ve heard that intuition or following our heart gets us into trouble  but most of the time  there is a reason for that gnawing feeling that something is just not right. listen to it and investigate; dig around to find out what’s causing these feelings..listen to and watch others. i remember the movie chariots of fire  about the olympic runner eric liddell  who explains to his sister  “i believe god made me for a purpose  but he also made me fast. and when i run i feel his pleasure.” as you see others light up and recognize their purpose  take note of the times you have felt a high level of energy when you were doing a certain task..passion is another way to understand what you were created for. there are certain issues that fire you up. even as you read this  you can think of one or two. take the necessary next step to get involved in such causes. don’t let the uncertainty of the second step keep you from taking the first step.*.what are you gifted in? what do people ask you for help with? what drains you  and what gives you energy? recognize that the life-giving activities are the ones you were created to do..the good news is that we were all created for a purpose  and we all have different purposes. once we understand what we are created for  life becomes so much more rewarding. imagine yourself as a leader helping those around you find their purpose..be aware-not everyone will appreciate your purpose or calling. i’ve blogged about the dream slayers in our lives. this is very similar. there are people who would rather have mole tunnels and rows of dead grass in their yard than a hound dog burrowing his nose in the ground. i recently gave a speech and challenged people to assess the lies in their life that cause them to hide behind a façade. not everyone wants to face that challenge. i’ve been called to help women be strong  bold and humble without being pushy  rude or weak. achieving that balance means first addressing the lie that knocked us off kilter..as for my little buddy louie—he is not a retriever; he’s a hunter. he is in his element when he hunts moles. he can pick up the scent of a mole several yards away. although i am really proud of his ability to scare them away  i don’t want to know what on earth he will do if he actually catches one. stay tuned!.* henry blackaby.out  damned mole! out  i say!.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  forgiveness  fundamentals in

i think we may only know each other through joe.”.“i don’t know you at all. why do you think you can call me by my first name? i’d prefer to be addressed as dr. tyson.”.needless to say  there were a few awkward moments after that announcement  and the recovery was tough. but i understood dr. tyson loud and clear. my boss  joe  never addressed him as dr. tyson  only wendell. i assumed it was okay for me to address him that way as well  even though we had never met. this was a classic case of being ill-prepared. and dr. tyson saw right through me. he didn’t know me  and me thinking that i had an “in” was not going to work with him..while we may prefer to be immediately relational  what must come first is authenticity  which goes a long way with louie and with humans. dogs are incredibly sensitive to people being who they “say” they are  but we humans have to work a bit harder to figure out who people really are. the tactic of someone acting like they know us defies our basic human need of wanting to be truly known and  even deeper  to be known and loved. the superficiality of today is leaving a relational void in so many people’s lives..i believe it is best to be authentic in every aspect of your life. brené brown talks about this in her famous ted talk about the power of vulnerability. the people she studied who seemed to have a strong sense of love and belonging shared these three things:.courage.compassion.authenticity.in her words  “these folks had the courage to be imperfect. they had a connection as a result of authenticity. they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they are.”.what you see is what you get when you connect with louie: no pretenses  no games—just the real deal. he expects that in return from the humans he comes in contact with  and he is confused when he senses otherwise. thanks to louie  i have learned to let go of who i thought i should be in order to be who i really am..*********************.louie had to say goodbye to his lifelong buddy  sampson  this weekend. sammy was a great pal to louie and was the real deal. we will always remember the fun walks and visits we had with him. louie will miss seeing and playing with him  as will everyone in our neighborhood. run and jump  little sampson. you’re bound by nothing that will ever hold you back from being the fun-loving pup you were created to be..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  courage  forgiveness  fundamentals in leadership  honesty  leadership  respect  servant leadership  transparency  trust  truth tags #creatingrelationships  #danisedistasi  #empoweringyourteam  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership  #selfawareness  danise distasi  trust leave a comment.louie and mercy.april 6  2017 april 6  2017 by danisedistasi.this is actually a picture of mercy. as cute as she is  she’s not the subject of this blog  though she will be the subject of one soon. no  this blog is about my little louie and the mercy i’ve had to grant him over and over..louie is certainly a transformed dog since i rescued him three years ago. most of his bad behaviors are behind us  but he has one persistent habit that just drives me crazy. i have two videos of him owning up to it. apparently  it’s a habit he’s unwilling to change..louie gets into my laundry basket  very neatly removes one item of clothing  drags it onto the floor  and proceeds to roll around on it. we wrote a blog about it a couple of months ago. and this behavior has been evident from day one..no matter how many times i point to the clothes on the floor after each episode and sternly say no  he continues to do it. i’ve walked into the room with him happily trotting behind me  and as soon as i see the clothes and turn to look at him  he’ll drop to the floor and roll over on his back. i don’t have to say a word. he knows he’s guilty  yet he persists..last week while i was shopping at kroger  i ran into our dog trainer  zig  and expressed my frustration about this habit of lou’s. i explained that he has done well in other arenas  but this just drives me nuts..zig paused before saying  “some things are not going to change. sometimes it is just too much for him to ignore. the laundry basket is just too much for louie to resist.” i had to admit zig was right. louie was never going to change this behavior..i continued my grocery shopping and thought about zig’s wisdom. there was something deeper to this whole laundry basket thing. was zig implying that it was my fault that louie got into the basket? i mean  after all  i kept my laundry basket on the floor. rather than doing that  i should just take the basket downstairs and do the laundry. and then  having folded my clean clothes and put them back in the basket  i should put them away rather than leave them on the floor..was my bad behavior triggering louie’s? admittedly  there’d be no problem without baskets of clothes sitting around. it’s too tempting for louie  just too much for him to resist..leader  think about this. certain behaviors in others just aren’t going to change. but what are we doing to trigger the behavior we wish would change? are we using a certain tone of voice  are we overcorrecting  do they not trust us? when they react  we respond sternly  and the cycle perpetuates itself.how we handle the things (people  behaviors  etc.) that just aren’t going to change speaks volumes to our teams:.how we handle the things (people  behaviors  etc.) that just aren’t going to change speaks volumes to our teams:.recognize that the behaviors you exhibit may cause others to react. be self-aware..stop hoping others will change. recognize that some things will never change. can you live with it? will it cause the demise of the team? is the behavior hindering or helping the team / the organization?.address the issues you can control. take responsibility for what you own. change what you can..mercy is an interesting term. it means compassion or forbearance shown especially to an offender; lenient or compassionate treatment. i especially like this definition: “a blessing that is an act of divine favor or compassion.” i certainly appreciate the mercy i have been shown by a loving and just god. i’m sure you do as well..while i have shown mercy to louie over the years  i have to take responsibility for my behavior that triggers a bad behavior in him. since my chance meeting with zig  i’ve moved my laundry basket  and louie is indeed a changed dog. he’s no longer tempted by the world of dirty laundry in a basket  and he hasn’t found other places from which to pull clothes onto the floor. this has been my lesson as much as his. and now he no longer needs to drop to the floor in an attempt to make amends. we’re good!.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  consistency  uncategorized tags #creatingrelationships  #danisedistasi  #developinggoals  #empoweringyourteam  #louiedistasi #danisedistasi #louiesleadershiplessons #leadership leave a comment.special announcement.march 20  2017 by danisedistasi.in celebration of louie’s birthday  we’re announcing the pre-release of his newly revised leadership book with special pricing for our blog readers.

according to merriam-webster’s definition  it is an awareness of one’s own personality or individuality. to this definition  i would add “flaws and all!” few leaders practice self-awareness because there is a mindset that says  “don’t be too introspective; keep moving ahead; don’t be too concerned about what other’s think of you.”.there is some validity in that advice  but as in everything  we need to balance that information. here are a few characteristics of relational leaders who are self-aware:.they know themselves well..they are always seeking and welcome feedback. they are not quick to make excuses or justifications when honest feedback is given..they are aware of the traits that hold them back  and take action to address them..they are conscious of their weaknesses and look to hire people who perform well in the areas where they lack expertise..they are natural delegators..they read people well (louie does this also. maybe he is more self-aware than i give him credit for)..self-awareness is key to our emotional health and the relational health of our team. it is actually freeing when you recognize the areas that are holding you back and release them so that others can step up to the plate and excel in their strengths..ask others to assist you in becoming more self-aware. the growth potential for not only you as a leader but for your team as well is astonishing and rewarding by way of a healthy culture and employee engagement..for now  i am still impressed with louie’s awareness of his environment. his self-awareness probably extends to his level of insecurities and fears only…but it’s a start!.monday  march 20  2017  is louie’s 5th birthday. my granddaughters decided his birthday should always be on the first day of spring because he is so full of life! send him an email to wish him a happy birthday louie@di-advisors.com..please click here to sign up for louie’s leadership lessons blog..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  fundamentals in leadership  healthy culture  honesty  leadership  the louie model  the paws model  transparency  trust  uncategorized tags #creatingrelationships  #developinggoals  #empoweringyourteam  #resolvingconflictpaws  #selfawareness  #simpleleadershipmodel leave a comment.post navigation.newer posts.← previous 1 2.subscribe to blog via email.enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email..email address	.search for:.recent posts.time to say goodbye may 22  2020.when the world was silent may 14  2020.back to normal?

[for more on leading with trust  see this article by my friend  randy conley  vice president of client services & trust practice leader for the ken blanchard companies.].a teammate may whine because the team is experiencing a daunting and uncomfortable change. loving people through such change does not mean we coddle them. it means we shed light on the situation  we share the truth  and we press through together..love is more impactful than complaining to others that someone is a whiner..our society tends to misuse the word love. in fact  very few understand the strength and character it takes to love others. we have fluffy commercials about it  emoticons  and facebook posts. martin luther king  jr. said  “darkness cannot drive out darkness  only light can do that. hate cannot drive out hate  only love can do that.”.and who can argue with this verse: “such love has no fear because perfect love expels all fear. if we are afraid  it is for fear of punishment  and this shows that we have not fully experienced his (god’s) perfect love.”.i doubt louie will be able to love the new dog in the neighborhood anytime soon. in fact  i’m sure he is hoping the dog moves away. in the meantime  i’m working on loving lou through this ordeal and rebuilding his confidence and trust in me so he knows i will never allow another dog to threaten him..but louie is a dog and as humans  we can choose to love. you can be the change agent for someone by removing fear of punishment or detrimental consequences and instilling love instead. such love is the gateway to experiencing god’s perfect love and the cornerstone on which excellent and effective leadership is built..note: my friend t.d. hughes knows how emphatic i am about leadership and love and recently sent me an article i thought you would enjoy as well. it’s okay to love your employees.**speaking of love  louie sends his love for a wonderful valentine’s day**.picture compliments of louie’s favorite place  best

that means!.january 24  2017 january 24  2017 by danisedistasi.our last blog detailed a journey i’m glad to say i am more than halfway through. if all goes well  my release date from all restrictions is february 1  2017. i am off all pain medication  and i took my first solo drive yesterday. i am beginning to see some normalcy slowly trickle back into my life. again  i am completely humbled by the continued outpouring of love and encouragement. thank you!.and then  there’s louie! louie was as traumatized as i was through this journey. he had to adjust to my being gone for two weeks; friends coming and going  walking and feeding him  playing with him  all while he constantly watched the door with the hope i would walk through it any minute..now that i’m home and he’s learned to trust my erratic movements with a cane  he seems to have settled back into some interesting habits: growling at people who come to my door (even his dog walkers) and jumping on the couch to sit directly across from me (better to watch me  he says)..one evening  a friend came by to take louie for a walk. after they finished and she came in to sit with me for awhile  he ran into the house  checked on me  and then ran upstairs  where he ran the length of the hallway several times. then  i heard a big commotion  and from where i was sitting  i could tell what that little rascal was doing. he was getting into my clothesbasket in my bathroom and taking all the clothes out of it  having no consideration whatsoever for the amount of time it took me to get the clothes into that basket..his continued motion  which was evident even though he was a floor above me  indicated he not only removed the items from the basket  he was also rolling in them—all of them! some time ago  i explained to zig  our trainer  louie’s annoying bad habit of rolling in the dirty laundry. i assumed it was because he wanted to surround himself with my smell  weird as that is..but zig assured me that was not it at all. louie was getting his smell on my clothes  showing his dominance over me. what? now that is a really annoying bad habit that makes me realize we are back to square one. there will be no dominance of louie over me..but this is not surprising. when it takes all my energy to walk from the living room to the kitchen  disciplining a dog is not high on my list  especially since we’ve been through this before. the pressure was off of louie to behave well  and when the pressure is off  he reverts back to his old habits..that is so like us. a while ago  i wrote a blog about something i learned from my time with the ken blanchard companies about the dynamics of change. one dynamic is that when the pressure is off  we revert to our original behaviors. well  the pressure was definitely off  and louie was back to some of his old habits. we will need to spend time correcting that. but rather than lament  i reflected on what this means as far as my recent journey and getting “back to normal.”.finally being able to drive did give me a sense of life getting back to normal. getting off medication  walking better  and looking forward to some normalcy were great goals for recovery. but did i really want normalcy to be my goal?.not this time  not this year. i am going to be intentional (keeping the pressure on) about breaking past the norm to live a well-meaning life by doing the following:.pruning activities  objects  and even some relationships  all to devote precious time to what matters;.being kind in thought  word  and deed  whether people deserve it or not. i don’t mean just merely being nice (and sometimes superficial and phony)  but being authentic and loving—speaking truth in love and showing those who differ from me  or have differing viewpoints  the compassion that only comes from faith in god;.taking time to listen in order to learn—and not rushing to the next project;.being still and having plenty of margin in my life;.laughing more; and.dancing (okay  that one is normal for me  but now takes on an even more special meaning). i will take time to dance more with my grandchildren and even my adult daughter because that’s what distasi kids do. my niece sara is getting married in september  and she has promised we will dance the night away. that is my goal for 2017..be intentional about breaking past the norm. life is too short and too easily interrupted for us to stay stuck in the status quo. and you are never too old to take that first step to crashing through the “same ol’  same ol’.”.as for louie  we have some work to do. as i have been writing  he slipped into my laundry room and pulled out a dishtowel. he is so bad. i know he has a large fan base of people who love him  but this annoying little habit just makes me shake my head. i suppose being intentionally kind starts now with little louie distasi!.click the cover to order louie’s leadership legacy book..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble

danisedistasi.today was the first day i was able to wrap my arms around louie and give him a huge bear hug. it was three weeks ago that i had an accident and our lives quickly changed. and in celebrating my ability to hug him and receive an under the neck snuggle from him  i thought it fitting to resume our blog after an unintentionally extended vacation..december 18  2016  was filled with great anticipation. it was one week before christmas  and the distasi family was planning to gather at my house to celebrate christmas. everything was set; the massive amounts of food  the decorations  gifts  and music. it was to be a celebration to top all the ones we had celebrated so far as a family..louie and i took our usual stroll early that morning. two days before  there had been a late evening ice storm  but this particular morning seemed okay as far as icy pavement was concerned. still  i was cautious and walked in the grass as much as possible..an elderly neighbor has a very long driveway  and louie and i had been taking her daily newspaper to her so she would not have to venture out and lean over to pick it up. as soon as i stepped on the driveway  my feet flew up in the air  and i landed on my left hip. i lost control of louie  and it took me a few moments to catch my breath. i couldn’t see louie  and panic was about to set in. his normal reaction when something startles him is to run away. and seeing his mama flying through the air had to have been startling..i forced myself to turn as far to the left as i could. there louie sat  close behind my left shoulder. i reached around to draw him close to me. as he tucked his head under my arm  i felt his shaking and heard him whimper. to hear him cry broke my heart  and my tears started to flow uncontrollably. i knew i could not move—and whatever would take place from that moment forward  it would be a long journey. louie chose to stay by me as the faithful friend that he is..a neighbor pulled up with his phone in hand  already calling 911  and i called my friend and neighbor cindy to pick up louie. i called my daughter  marisa  and the network of community  family  and friends jumped into action. everyone’s life was interrupted on december 18  2016..after a jarring ambulance ride  surgery to repair a femur that was fractured in two places  a total hip replacement  five days in the hospital  and physical therapy  i was released to marisa and matt’s home for respite care and to celebrate christmas with the two cutest nurses on the face of the earth. louie had been well taken care of by my wonderful neighbors who had walked him  let him stay in their homes  taken him to daycare to play  and given him more love than he could imagine..life interrupted has taught louie and me a few things:.we appreciate life and the little things: although that seems so cliché  it was the small steps of accomplishment that filled me with joy. every day  i set new goals to accomplish—goals i never would have dreamed to set before. for instance  i learned to get out of bed  to go to the bathroom  and to take my meds without having to wake my daughter to help me. and to carry a cup of coffee in the morning to enjoy my quiet time. mea and evi helped me do things as they watched me improve. christmas had a deeper meaning this year with sincere thankfulness  love  and joy!.you really do know who your friends are: so many people dropped everything to help. it was a terrible strain on marisa and matt as they took care of me. so many friends offered to grocery shop  run errands  and stay with me when i finally came home. my sisters and cousin packed their clothes and took turns staying overnight. my brothers were calling  visiting  and bringing food. the neighbors who took care of louie were such godsends. many people could not help because of logistics  but they checked in and prayed..you have to move out of your comfort zone: this was a tough one for louie and me. i had to let people help me. what a humbling position to be in; i was helpless. i have never stayed in a hospital other than to give birth. i don’t take any medicines  and i have never fractured a single bone. the outpouring of love and encouragement has been overwhelming. louie had to be comfortable with people coming and going in and out of our home and driving him to and from daycare. but we both pressed on through pain  frustration  fear  and being uncomfortable. it was difficult  but i believe we made it past the hardest part of this process. there’s still much more healing to take place and there will always be a next move out of our comfort zone. i have no doubt we’ll press through that too..some things just do not matter: the superficiality of the holidays clashed with the richness of genuine  loving relationships. there can be no comparison of the things that are bought with the things that are sought  caught  and taught. the characteristics of love  joy  and peace are important for us to live and pass on to others. it takes effort  but it is worth the time and effort. i am a better person because of the love  joy  and peace that others shared with me this season..2017 is going to be a great year of love and strength. louie is a better dog because he chose faithfulness over running away. he trusted and allowed others into his world to help us! we are closer because of these last few weeks. thank you to so many for being in my life and for your prayers and support!.click here to sign up for louie’s email list..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and

expectancy.december 12  2016 december 13  2016 by danisedistasi.louie  my adopted pup  and i were walking on a beautiful fall day when we saw one of his pug buddies—or so we thought. his friend sammy is a tan and black pug with a unique characteristic: his tongue protrudes ever so slightly. i recognized that the person walking him was not his owner. that’s not unusual since many of us in the community need others to walk our dogs on occasion. louie was excited to see his buddy and could hardly wait to romp and play..as we approached  i asked if the dog was sammy  because he had the same markings and same characteristic of a slightly protruding tongue. the person walking him said no. but louie quickly ran up to the sammy look-alike; it did not take him long to realize this was not his buddy  and then he became indignant as if he was mad at the pug for not being sammy..we quickly said our good-byes while louie kicked up his feet and snarled just to make sure the dog understood he was not even close to being sammy..i realized louie’s expectations for playing with his friend were unmet  and disappointment had set in quickly. based on all appearances  louie was expecting to have fun and play  but that expectation was not to be filled that day..this time of year  the majority of us have many expectations that  when unmet for whatever reason  will disappoint us. people have a hard time moving on from such setbacks. i think these disappointments occur because we’ve set ourselves up for failure when we box up our expectations in the hopes that they will be fulfilled..instead  what if we had a spirit of expectancy? you may wonder what the difference is between having expectations and having a spirit of expectancy. a spirit of expectancy is what very young children usually possess. they have the mindset that something wonderful is about to happen  but with no expectation of specifics. while they may wish for something on their christmas list  it is their heart of expectancy that is truly magical. it is the hopefulness of something wonderful. for me  that may entail time with my family  but without expectation that the time meets any specific criteria—it is simply time together..another example occurred on the holiest of nights. for centuries  people expected the messiah to come amongst their midst. in this expectation  they envisioned a king  surrounded by throngs of noble men and women and trumpets blaring. because of these expectations they missed the wonder of all that took place on that quiet  serene night when the stars were brightly shining..yet only those with a spirit of expectancy  whose hearts were open to the wonder of what only the creator of the universe could put into action  witnessed the birth of the king in a simple  lowly manger..expectations for particular things and events always run the risk of disappointing us  since many times  events and what others do are out of our control. as we wind down our year  rather than focusing on the disappointments of unmet expectations  let’s look forward with a heart of expectancy and see if that doesn’t lighten our spirits with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen..while louie experienced disappointment by not having his expectations met with the look-alike sammy  it did not dampen his spirit of expectancy. he still walks out of our home with the hope that something wonderful is about to happen. something as simple as seeing a dear neighbor who pats him on the head or gives him belly rubs lends to his heart of wonder..click the image for

november 29  2016 by danisedistasi.the subject line might offend louie. in fact  it might offend you as well. but let’s face it—in the heat of the recent political battle  many of us are shaking our heads while trying to understand what just happened. one thing i do know is that disrespect for people with differing opinions is at an all-time high..the rude rhetoric on all sides of the political spectrum gave me pause and made me think of louie and some of his not-so-friendly foes. i am convinced that if people were to act the way our pets do  we would all get along better. for example  sometimes louie might see a dog that challenges him. the two will snarl and growl and perhaps even bark at each other. however  the minute we walk side by side with the dog and its owner  they seem to get along. there is something about being intentional and walking alongside someone you have a disagreement with..louie has done this with my niece’s dog  buddy. those two little boys will scrunch their noses  curl their lips  show their teeth  stand their hair up  and bark in such a high pitch that people turn their heads with a look of concern. andrea laughs  assuring everyone in sight that the dogs are actually cousins and are fine with each other. it sure doesn’t seem like it when they are facing one another. however  as soon as we start walking  they are fine together..louie also behaves this way with rambunctious claire  his other cousin noli  his neighbor snickers  and a new boxer in the community named socks. what is it about being side by side with their supposed nemesis? i think there are several things:.it is less threatening..they are on equal ground..they see the same vision of what lies ahead..they walk with the same pace..it is easier to carry the other’s burden. (okay  this one relates to humans  not louie.).what if some of our leaders were intentional about walking side by side instead of duking it out? i am reminded of an article i wrote in 2005 when i worked with ken blanchard titled “leading with your heart takes humility.” although it was written over eleven years ago  the premise holds true today: humility is the key to excelling in leadership. and servant leaders are humble enough to walk beside someone they disagree with..i won’t share the full article here (you can find it at this link)  but here are some of the highlights:.something is glaringly missing from leadership today. sadly  many leadership programs are missing just one key ingredient: the heart. not just the heart of the issue or the heart of the matter—the heart of the people..what gets in your way? what truly is your motive for being a leader or wanting to lead others? is it for selfish gain or to better others?.many times  our ego gets in the way and what bubbles up out of our hearts are things like pride  selfishness  and even fear..how can you push past what holds you back? in getting past the barriers  is the challenge as a leader to balance confidence with humility to fight ego issues? ken blanchard often uses the quote  “humility is not thinking less of yourself. it’s thinking of yourself less.” every time you make a leadership decision  are you thinking of yourself or others?.confidence does not come from being in a dominant position and leading by intimidation. doing this will cause you to lose respect from others  and any talk about values or integrity will be ignored. humility  however  is not something they teach us in business schools. it is a character trait that is honed over time with truth and love..our businesses  organizations  and families are hungry for leadership coupled with humility. it takes commitment to make the necessary changes to have a healthy culture and humble leaders..perhaps our world could learn a lesson from louie about being intentional and walking side by side with others rather than snarling at them. while louie doesn’t understand humility  his actions speak louder than his woof. he is more than willing to walk alongside others. as i watch his actions  i am convinced that we humans have much to learn from our dogs..louie’s newest revision is now available. click on the book to order..click

comments.you can’t make me something i don’t want to be!.november 13  2016 november 15  2016 by danisedistasi.louie was not having it. he planted all four paws on the floor and would not move an inch. his face let me know he was not pleased. at all..“louie ” i said sternly as i tried to squeeze his 40 pounds of muscle where it didn’t want to go. “this is only for two hours  if that. surely you can oblige me.”.i sat back and stared at him  exasperated. for the last few halloweens  i’ve donned a cruella de vil look and spent the evening with my grandchildren. this year i thought it would be fun to take louie along in a dalmatian outfit. except there were no dalmatian costumes for dogs. the closest thing i could find was a child’s costume for a spotted cow..i had imagined how it would turn out. louie might not share my enthusiasm for this creative costume. but he’d forget all about it when he set eyes on my granddaughters  evi and mea. he’d jump out of the car and happily trot with them along the street  greeting other children  trying to get a peek into their candy loot. i just knew louie would have more fun than he could imagine if he could just push through wearing a silly cow outfit and look as much like a dalmatian as he could..i also imagined it would make a great blog lesson: all about pressing through uncomfortable situations to enjoy the outcome. sounds good  right?.being someone we’re not.but none of that happened. yes  lou was happy to see evi and mea. he did enjoy it when other children came up to love on him. but he hated his costume and was mad at me the entire time. he wouldn’t even pose for a picture  and believe me  that’s not like him..i finally took the costume off and let him be louie..too often we find ourselves being something we don’t want to be. maybe it’s of our own doing — because we think we need to fit in  and it requires being someone “different.” but often it’s because someone else expects us to be different than what we are..maybe it’s a negative thing: a boss requires us to be something based on their own insecurities. or maybe it’s positive: a leader sees potential in us that we don’t see or can even imagine  and they want to coach us to be better..no matter the reason  we resist because it is uncomfortable to be something we are not. we don’t want to don a costume and fake it..can’t make anyone change.it’s tough to balance being authentic and at the same time develop beyond mediocrity toward excellence. it can feel like donning a facade and “faking it till we make it.” what should leaders do to help folks grow?.if you’re in a position of leadership  you can suggest someone continue to develop. you can provide tools  mentoring  and ongoing training. but you can’t make them be something they don’t want to be. each person is responsible for taking that first step to wanting to make significant changes in their lives..still  there are ways to influence those in whom you see potential. for example:.watch to see whether the person shows an eagerness to learn and grow  i.e.  reading books and asking for help..ask them where do they see themselves going? what is their end goal?.share with them what potential you see in them..be sure your expectations align with their skillset and desires..if their end goal and desires outweigh their skillset  place them on a realistic development plan and be clear about expectations..greater than they imagine.when louie and i arrived back home  he was one tired pup. he slinked upstairs to his little bed to lay down. his expression told me he was still traumatized by the costume. but as i knelt down to give him a kiss  i looked into his eyes and saw a little spark..it was a look that said  “if you are trying to make me be something different than who i am  at least make me a lion!”.and with that  he tucked his head into the fold of his front paw and fell fast asleep. no doubt  that evening he dreamt of being a lion..louie the lion…hear me

oldest granddaughter  evi  share our dog louie’s story with her younger sister  mea. though you may have heard this “tail” a time or two before  i thought you would enjoy this rendition:.“a long time ago  there was a little dog who was all alone in the woods. he was scared and afraid and felt very  very alone. it was nighttime and then daylight and then nighttime  again and again. once  he saw another little animal and thought  ‘oh  that looks like someone who could be my friend.’ but the animal was a mean cat. it hissed and clawed at the poor little dog  scratching his ear till it started to bleed. ‘my ’ said the pup. ‘i guess it doesn’t want to be my friend.’ the little dog still has a mark on his ear..“the poor little dog was sad  but he kept on going because he knew somewhere  someone would love him. he was so tired that he couldn’t keep his head up. he came to a road and a woman who was driving by saw him and picked him up. she took him to a place filled with lots of people and other dogs. the people called and called and called all sorts of places to find out if anyone owned the dog. they put up signs and waited and waited  but no one came to see the little dog. he still felt all alone..“one morning  the people put the little dog in a van and drove him far  far away. they took him to an adopt-a-pet store. there  he saw a nice lady who took him home. he was scared at first  but then the lady opened the door to her home  and two little girls were waiting for him. they hugged him and kissed his head and called him their brother. louie finally found a place he called home and two sisters who loved him very much.”.mea’s mouth dropped open as she squealed  “lou-weeeeee?”.“yep  that’s louie’s story ” evi proudly announced..i smiled as i heard the tale so poignantly shared. once again  louie’s story tugged at my heart as i thought about our little dog wandering the streets and wooded areas  not knowing where he was or where he should go. it is even sadder to think that despite the shelter’s efforts to find his family  no one came to take him home. louie was unclaimed and unloved—a very sad state  indeed..since he first came to live in my home  there has been no question that he is loved. i’ve gladly claimed him as my little pal  and he truly is a brother to evi and mea. he knows where home is. every time we take a walk  he’ll look up at me with those big  brown eyes  and i’ll ask  “do you want to go home  lou?” with a spring in his step and dogged determination  he’ll prance all the way home with little guidance from me. i have been unwavering in working through life’s tough spots to build a relationship of trust  and it has paid off in huge dividends of joy for louie and me as well as for evi  mea  and many other people whom louie has come to know and love..being unclaimed and unloved is not limited to adopted pups. many people in our lives have suffered through this emotional pain. many times  these people are close friends  teammates  bosses  or fellow board members. we never know who they are because  in today’s shallow society  we don’t take the time to learn about people’s lives. we often wonder what is wrong with individuals who act out  but in many cases  these people may be unclaimed and unloved and are looking for others they can trust. don’t be like the cat in louie’s tale and lash out at them..before passing judgment on others  take the time to learn their stories. people are fascinating  and everyone has a unique history. once you learn about someone and take the time to get to know them  you’ll see them blossom and grow. learning about others is imperative to help our team build trust and learn to walk in their strengths. be the leader who is unwavering in working through tough spots to build a relationship of trust. this effort will pay off in huge dividends of joy and—believe it or not—productivity..if you are reading this blog  i want you to know you are not unclaimed or unloved  no matter what has happened to you in your past. god is unwavering in his love for us. it is up to us to joyfully accept and receive such love..as for louie—he has taught me so much about love and determination. i am never without a lesson from this little chap. he has also opened my eyes to that fact that my sweet evi is carrying on the nonna tradition of being the “best story maker” ever.

lou!.october 12  2016 october 12  2016 by danisedistasi.louie and i went for an early morning walk. i was eager to get in some exercise ahead of a busy client day. just as we crossed the street in front of a wooded area  i heard a screeching sound  as though two cats were fighting. without hesitation  lou ran as fast as he could in the opposite direction. he didn’t look around. he didn’t stop. he just took off running. once lou was at the end of the leash  his body stopped  but his legs kept going. i had to laugh because he reminded me of the jetsons with jethro  the dog  on the treadmill..only when he felt we were at a safe distance did he turn to look back with a worried look on his face. he would have nothing to do with cats  much less getting in the middle of their fight. as we walked at our usual clipped pace  i thought  “louie is a very smart dog.” oh  if only we humans could learn to run as fast as we can when others try to pull us into arguments..conflict certainly happens with our friends or families  but it is very disruptive when it happens with our teams. it creates dissension and stagnates creativity and productivity  not to mention what it does to the cultural health of an organization..we would love to offer our assistance when two coworkers are fighting so that we can feel good about helping  yet it is not always that simple or straightforward. sometimes  it is best to run in the other direction  just as louie does..there are other times  though  we may be able to offer help. in my coaching practice  i often listen to employees or leaders vent about conflict or upsetting situations. executive coaching may appear to be different from dealing with coworkers  but i have found the following process extremely helpful:.venting – people need a place to vent. sometimes  being able to verbally process helps us let off some steam and get a clearer perspective..listening – lend an empathetic ear and listen to the person. let them know you care about their situation yet you care more about the relationship..reframing – many times when someone is upset about something  he or she may not always see a different perspective of the situation. you could help that person by asking questions such as  what if the other person were challenging you with a different intent than what you assume? what is your responsibility in the situation? could it be that the other person did not intend to upset you? reframe the situation and help them to see a different perspective..envisioning – envisioning will help them to see what it would look like if they were sitting across the table from the person they are in conflict with  and talking one-on-one. this is very helpful for the person to visualize a tough conversation before he or she actually does. again  it gives them an entirely different perspective..sometimes louie’s method is actually the best. there are many times when it is not worth getting in the middle of two people who are fighting. no matter what you try to do to help  you might find that it will backfire on you..before you take that step in helping people resolve a conflict  you need to make sure that they are willing to work at it and to understand that the end goal is to mend the relationship. some people have no intentions of reconciling  and it makes it tough to work with them. the catfight will revolve around who was right and who was wrong—and there will be no resolution to the conflict..louie does the first two steps very well. he lets me talk things out and listens intently  with those big  brown  soulful eyes. then with a sweet content look on his face  he yawns and moves on. that’s a signal to me it’s time to get over whatever it was that upset me and to deal with the situation. thanks  lou  for such wisdom!.click the image for information on how to order louie’s leadership lessons.categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  conflict  forgiveness

protective—what’s the difference?.september 27  2016 september 28  2016 by danisedistasi.louie and i have a very touchy subject to discuss  one that is also a continuing issue. just when i think louie is over this particular behavior  he reverts to square one  and we have to start training all over again..every time someone comes to my door  he has a very strong reaction; he starts barking  growling  and lowering his head—all signs that he is ready to attack  even though he has never attacked anyone. while this is great for all the intruders that come to my door  it can also be annoying since most are guests or delivering expected packages..my guests will walk in  fully expecting an overly excited dog to greet them. i’ve worked with louie to sit and remain seated until i give him a release signal. only then can he approach the guest and smell the person. but the minute i do not enforce this training  he goes right back to his bad behavior..ever since i’ve known louie  he has had only great experiences at my front door. i have welcomed everyone who has entered with hugs  and they love seeing louie. he has never encountered someone breaking in  trying to kidnap me  or causing any commotion whatsoever at the front door. the people he encounters are simply entering my home..i had to ask myself  what would cause this behavior? did he have a bad past experience? is he afraid someone will take him from his cushy environment? does he not want me to give anyone else any attention? none of this made sense..when i share about his behavior with others  everyone says he is just being protective  and i’m left again to ask why. why does he think i need protection? and if i do need it  then shouldn’t he react the same way when we are on a walk and someone approaches me? but he doesn’t. he could care less. in fact  i am sure that if someone with ill intent approached me  he would run in the opposite direction as fast as he could. he doesn’t care if i pet other dogs  and all my neighbors can attest to this behavior—but only outside..inside my house  it’s a different story. over the last three years  i have realized that louie is indeed protecting his territory. given his history  he has a profound need to feel safe and clearly does not want anyone disrupting that. while i appreciate that and want him to feel safe  it annoys me to fight this battle every time someone comes to my door. being territorial is not very becoming and can turn many people away. i have to shake my head and wonder why dogs  especially louie  behave that way. and then it hit me: i am the very same way. i am territorial..for instance  i struggled with sharing the louie leadership model in our last blog because of the thoughts that slowly began to creep into my mind and heart. someone  i thought  will steal it and call it their own (no one ever does that in the training/consulting world  right?) or say they thought of it first. and so on. such thoughts continued to color my excitement about developing and sharing the model and the louie stories that accompanied each step. while i shake my head and ask louie why he acts like he does  i had to ask myself the same question. what benefit is it to anyone if i am territorial and hoard a new idea?.it is humbling to realize that a behavior is very unbecoming. we humans are so often territorial when we think we have a great idea  a unique method  or a new creation. an old expression often brings me back to reality:.there is nothing new under the sun!.louie’s behavior is typical of most dogs. for humans to want to protect their turf is normal. but just because it is “typical” or “normal” behavior does not mean it is acceptable. i shared the louie model because it is a really great model and not mine to hoard. it was gifted to me by the one who blessed me with louie—god. and i believe god wants me to give freely to others the gifts with which he has blessed me..now if i can just get louie to see our home as a gift that we should share with others  we’d be so much better off! we have a lot of work to do!.***********.louie had to say goodbye to his sweet cousin  lily  last week! our family will always have fond memories of her running around the pool  trying to keep everyone in line. in the last year  she finally realized our family was not easily corraled. now you have thousand of pools to run around  lil

celebration of the 3rd anniversary of louie’s adoption  we decided to to do an extended blog  introducing our louie leadership model..our story began three years ago in the rolling hills of boyd county  kentucky—a place i never knew existed. it’s your typical love story: boy meets girl  boy woos girl with his charming ways and big brown eyes  girl is swept off her feet  and they fall in love and live happily ever after. except in this story  the boy is an adopted puppy named louie..although i have a tremendous amount of leadership experience  i never truly understood leadership until i met this little guy..our blog  and my soon-to-be-released third book  louie’s leadership lessons  are compilations of time-tested leadership models  heart-warming stories of courage and love  and techniques for overcoming common issues such as pride  fear  and doubt—all illustrated by eye-opening experiences with my rescue dog. the time i spent with him and his trainer was life changing..this extended blog is the introduction to our new book and contains nuggets of wisdom i’ve learned over the decades about leadership and the gift of relationships with a fresh perspective renewed by louie’s point of view..i have distilled all louie has taught me into a leadership model that is easy to remember and easy to follow. when you have a leadership dilemma  ask yourself  “what would louie do?” the answer is in his name: louie..love.louie was either lost or abandoned in kentucky and made his way to cincinnati  where i live  through a number of shelters. although i love dogs  i had decided not to get another one for many reasons—that is  until i just happened to stop by petsmart while they were conducting an adopt-a-pet weekend and encountered this abandoned mutt with big brown. i tossed my concerns aside  brought him home  and named him louie distasi. i soon discovered that louie had brought a lot of emotional baggage to the relationship. he demonstrated behaviors that deeply concerned me  and i engaged a dog trainer to help address them. i quickly realized i needed training as much as louie did  if not more so..i’m not afraid of tough lessons  and i’m always looking for ways to improve my leadership skills. but working with louie was challenging. the bottom line was that louie needed acceptance  consistency  discipline  and—above all—unconditional love. i wasn’t sure i was equipped to provide all that..when i first met louie  he was very sweet and subdued in his crate. several hours after we arrived home  he became much more active. i loved louie when he was a good little dog  but i didn’t love him so much when he started to act out and behaved badly when people came to the door  etc. it was a struggle  and i had to make a choice to love him. i decided to commit to loving this abandoned pup  in spite of his baggage..employees can be like louie. they bring a lot of baggage to the job and may be hard to love at times. one of the most critical needs for any human being is the need to feel loved. all of us have this innate desire  yet it is one of the most difficult to fulfill. c. s. lewis said it best:.“to be loved but not known is comforting but superficial. to be known and not loved is our greatest fear. but to be fully known and truly loved is  well  a lot like being loved by god. it is what we need more than anything. it liberates us from pretense  humbles us out of our self-righteousness  and fortifies us for any difficulty life can throw at us.”.love is not merely a warm fuzzy feeling; love in action is the aspect that is important in leadership. when i mention the word “love” in the workplace  i receive a tremendous amount of pushback. people say  “don’t bring it up; you’ll have hr issues.” i question whether people understand what love really means..while employees can be hard to love at times (maybe most of the time)  it is still your choice to love or be indifferent toward them. let’s look at the characteristics of leaders who love:.they are patient..they are kind..they honor other people..they are honest..they are protective..they are trustworthy..they are always hopeful..they persevere through difficult situations..they are other seeking and other serving..they manage their emotions well..of course  there are also things that they are not:.they aren’t envious..they aren’t boastful..they aren’t prideful..they don’t keep records of wrongs..the characteristics of loving leaders are those that leaders should display when they are working with their people—baggage and all. that’s what love in action looks like..servant leaders are those who display the characteristics above. they are humble enough to serve and strong enough to lead..objectives and goals.the next thing i learned in the course of training louie was that  as a leader  i needed clear objectives and plans for how to achieve them. this is true with our teams at work  as well. objectives must be clear and specific. they have to be trackable. they have to be relevant. they have to be attainable and motivating..i engaged a trainer who taught me that my first goal in this journey with louie was to establish my role as leader. yep—i actually had to learn how to be louie’s alpha. i wrongly assumed he would know i was in charge because i’m bigger than him  i own the house  i pay for the meals. assuming is a mistake many leaders make. throughout our blog  you’ll read the importance of objectives and goals with each lesson i learned through louie..understanding.another lesson i learned was to truly understand that louie had “stuff” in his background. fear and anxiety issues were at the top of the list. these may have come from abandonment or abuse—it’s hard to say. but it is not unlike everyone we meet  whether he or she is on our team  or just a person whose path we crossed in the grocery store. every human being needs to feel loved and valued. it is our innermost need  and it was this little dog’s need as well. he had never had a sense of being valued in his life  and he needed to know that someone cared about him. i had to understand louie’s struggles to love him  which would enable me to set clear objectives and goals for our journey together. i needed to understand louie’s issues. it wasn’t easy to get past some of them. they were real and profound..as leaders  we need to take the time to understand our people. we need to realize that there’s always something about a person’s circumstances that we don’t know  and before we judge people  we need to try to understand them..when you run into an issue with someone and your first inclination is to become upset  try the paws method to help you analyze the situation before doing something you may regret:.pause…breathe! allow oxygen to get to your brain..ask the person questions: “what’s going on?” “can you tell me more?” “help me understand.” “is everything ok?” ask yourself questions: “why does this aggravate me?”.use wisdom. choose your words wisely. i would much rather have people feel uncomfortable waiting for me to find the right words than i ever would with words that could be hurtful..seek to understand. once you pause  ask questions  and choose your words wisely  you will naturally seek to understand. remember  everyone has “stuff” in his or her backgrounds. and so do you!.as leaders  we need to make an effort to understand. take time to understand your people and avoid making assumptions. throughout this blog  there are many lessons relating to how i learned to understand louie  who could not verbally communicate with me. these lessons will help you understand how others communicate and process ideas differently than you do—and that’s ok..investment.i then learned to invest my time and talent into developing louie. we should ask ourselves  “how much time do we invest in our teams? our families? our friends?” take the time to get to know people and invest in them..this picture breaks my heart. this is louie the first night he came home with me. he curled up in the corner  scared and alone. i put a pillow next to him to provide some comfort. louie now sleeps in a very open bed in my bedroom because he feels safe with me  and i with him. i chose to invest a tremendous amount of time in louie so that he could learn to trust and love me. it took time. everything takes time. you cannot go wrong by investing your time getting to know people. take them out to lunch. ask them questions. this point relates back to understanding. it links to feeling valued  and it relates to feeling loved. take time to gather information. you never know what you can uncover when you give your time..there are many suggestions for  and examples of  investing in others throughout our blog. get to know people  spend time with them  share your talents and your skill set; put effort into your relationships with people because you want to give without receiving anything in return. i can guarantee that if you are a leader  and you do this  your team will be more productive  creative  and effective. it is the foundation for a healthy culture. invest your time..empowerment.the last step in my leadership training with louie was to empower him. empowering your team is essential  but it’s not simply letting people do whatever they want to do. empowering is taking the time to love them and establishing clear objectives and goals. it is understanding them  and investing in them. once you do these things  your people will be empowered to use their gifts and talents to do their jobs; and in doing so  you empower them to be the people god created them to be—not who you think they should be. they will be loved and valued..louie is an entirely different dog today because i love him. i took the time to set up a development plan and was clear about objectives and goals for him to be a good  healthy dog and for us to enjoy a relationship together. i had to understand his needs. i had to understand his background. i had to figure out what was going on with him. i invested time  my skill set  and other people’s skill sets to help develop him. he is empowered to be a fun-loving  free little dog..my work with louie is not unlike leading our teams. transformation occurs when we apply the louie leadership model: love  objectives  understanding  investment  and empowerment  as well as the paws model: pause  ask  wisdom  and seek. throughout louie’s leadership lessons  you will see more examples of these two models wrapped in stories of love  struggles  and immense joy..while it brings me great pleasure to know that louie is a transformed dog  i am the one who has been profoundly changed into a better leader because of the lessons i’ve learned from my experiences with him. we look forward to continuing our journey with you through our blog..sign up for louie’s mailing list..categories balance of strong  be authentic  bold and humble  conflict  consistency  courage  fear and pride  forgiveness  fundamentals in leadership  healthy culture  honesty  leadership  lifelong relationships  people process differently  relationships  respect  servant leadership  the louie model  the paws model  transparency  trust  truth 4 comments.post navigation.older posts.newer posts.← previous 1 2 3 4 … 7 next →.subscribe to blog via email.enter your email

dog trainer,he’s back with a unique leadership model – unleash love.skip to content	.menu	.lead like louie blog.eradicating bullying from the classroom to the boardroom.he’s back with a unique leadership model.september 17  2016 september 16  2016 by danisedistasi.we hope you enjoyed your summer. in celebration of the 3rd anniversary of louie’s adoption  we decided to to do an extended blog  introducing our louie leadership model..our story began three years ago in the rolling hills of boyd county  kentucky—a place i never knew existed. it’s your typical love story: boy meets girl  boy woos girl with his charming ways and big brown eyes  girl is swept off her feet  and they fall in love and live happily ever after. except in this story  the boy is an adopted puppy named louie..although i have a tremendous amount of leadership experience  i never truly understood leadership until i met this little guy..our blog  and my soon-to-be-released third book  louie’s leadership lessons  are compilations of time-tested leadership models  heart-warming stories of courage and love  and techniques for overcoming common issues such as pride  fear  and doubt—all illustrated by eye-opening experiences with my rescue dog. the time i spent with him and his trainer was life changing..this extended blog is the introduction to our new book and contains nuggets of wisdom i’ve learned over the decades about leadership and the gift of relationships with a fresh perspective renewed by louie’s point of view..i have distilled all louie has taught me into a leadership model that is easy to remember and easy to follow. when you have a leadership dilemma  ask yourself  “what would louie do?” the answer is in his name: louie..love.louie was either lost or abandoned in kentucky and made his way to cincinnati  where i live  through a number of shelters. although i love dogs  i had decided not to get another one for many reasons—that is  until i just happened to stop by petsmart while they were conducting an adopt-a-pet weekend and encountered this abandoned mutt with big brown. i tossed my concerns aside  brought him home  and named him louie distasi. i soon discovered that louie had brought a lot of emotional baggage to the relationship. he demonstrated behaviors that deeply concerned me  and i engaged a dog trainer to help address them. i quickly realized i needed training as much as louie did  if not more so..i’m not afraid of tough lessons  and i’m always looking for ways to improve my leadership skills. but working with louie was challenging. the bottom line was that louie needed acceptance  consistency  discipline  and—above all—unconditional love. i wasn’t sure i was equipped to provide all that..when i first met louie  he was very sweet and subdued in his crate. several hours after we arrived home  he became much more active. i loved louie when he was a good little dog  but i didn’t love him so much when he started to act out and behaved badly when people came to the door  etc. it was a struggle  and i had to make a choice to love him. i decided to commit to loving this abandoned pup  in spite of his baggage..employees can be like louie. they bring a lot of baggage to the job and may be hard to love at times. one of the most critical needs for any human being is the need to feel loved. all of us have this innate desire  yet it is one of the most difficult to fulfill. c. s. lewis said it best:.“to be loved but not known is comforting but superficial. to be known and not loved is our greatest fear. but to be fully known and truly loved is  well  a lot like being loved by god. it is what we need more than anything. it liberates us from pretense  humbles us out of our self-righteousness  and fortifies us for any difficulty life can throw at us.”.love is not merely a warm fuzzy feeling; love in action is the aspect that is important in leadership. when i mention the word “love” in the workplace  i receive a tremendous amount of pushback. people say  “don’t bring it up; you’ll have hr issues.” i question whether people understand what love really means..while employees can be hard to love at times (maybe most of the time)  it is still your choice to love or be indifferent toward them. let’s look at the characteristics of leaders who love:.they are patient..they are kind..they

up in the corner  scared and alone. i put a pillow next to him to provide some comfort. louie now sleeps in a very open bed in my bedroom because he feels safe with me  and i with him. i chose to invest a tremendous amount of time in louie so that he could learn to trust and love me. it took time. everything takes time. you cannot go wrong by investing your time getting to know people. take them out to lunch. ask them questions. this point relates back to understanding. it links to feeling valued  and it relates to feeling loved. take time to gather information. you never know what you can uncover when you give your time..there are many suggestions for  and examples of  investing in others throughout our blog. get to know people  spend time with them  share your talents and your skill set; put effort into your relationships with people because you want to give without receiving anything in return. i can guarantee that if you are a leader  and you do this  your team will be more productive  creative  and effective. it is the foundation for a healthy culture. invest your time..empowerment.the last step in my leadership training with louie was to empower him. empowering your team is essential  but it’s not simply letting people do whatever they want to do. empowering is taking the time to love them and establishing clear objectives and goals. it is understanding them  and investing in them. once you do these things  your people will be empowered to use their gifts and talents to do their jobs; and in doing so  you empower them to be the people god created them to be—not who you think they should be. they will be loved and valued..louie is an entirely different dog today because i love him. i took the time to set up a development plan and was clear about objectives and goals for him to be a good  healthy dog and for us to enjoy a relationship together. i had to understand his needs. i had to understand his background. i had to figure out what was going on with him. i invested time  my skill set  and other people’s skill sets to help develop him. he is empowered to be a fun-loving  free little dog..my work with louie is not unlike leading our teams. transformation occurs when we apply the louie leadership model: love  objectives  understanding  investment  and empowerment  as well as the paws model: pause  ask  wisdom  and seek. throughout louie’s leadership lessons  you will see more examples of these two models wrapped in stories of love  struggles  and immense joy..while it brings me great pleasure to know that louie is a transformed dog  i am the one who has been profoundly changed into a better leader because of the lessons i’ve learned from my experiences with him. we look forward to continuing our journey with you through our

prosciutto,chapter 9.the market was a straight shot across highway 98 from the garden  so she was there pretty quickly. she pulled into the parking lot and found jake sitting on a porch with his hand propped up shielding his eyes from the sun as he read a book. when she got closer  her face lit up in a smile. it was obvious he had fallen asleep sitting out there..jake opened his eyes and slowly was able to focus on a pair of woven sandals planted in the ground facing him. he followed the feet that were in them up a pair of fit  although pale legs. those legs led to a blue jean skirt  not too short but short enough to be interesting. from there on it turned into a white button down shirt opened at the collar revealing an attractive neck at the end of which was the pleasant and smiling face of debbie baylor. as he rose to greet her  his eyes suddenly popped wide open and his arms flew out grabbing at open air for support..“whoa  easy there jake. don’t loose your balance ” she said..“i was hoping you’d come by ” he said recovering “i was worried it was a bad idea to call you twice the day after i first met you.”.“why?”.“oh  you know – crazy stalker?” he replied..“c’mon  i was just messing with you about that last night.”.“good.”.“speaking of which  how did you get my number?”.“bt gave it to me  but not until after i had to make up some story to him about how you gave it to me at the bar  but i lost it.”.“and how did you lose it?” she asked making fists on her hips and feigning some sort of emotional injury..“i think i told him i dropped it on the beach ” he replied..“you still gonna make me lunch?” she asked..“anything you want  or actually anything that can be made off the shelves of the market.”.as they walked inside  jake introduced debbie to ashley  a local girl who worked for jake part time..“oh yeah  miss necessities ” ashley said smiling at debbie..“what?” jake asked..“when my car died down here  i came straight to the store for necessities. you know suntan oil  deodorant  and two cases of wine. you’ve got a great selection  by the way  for a shop this size.”.“ah ” jake said. “ok  what can i get you?”.“well  let me see what you have ” debbie said as she took a shopping basket. she walked alone down the each of the five narrow aisles left to right without picking anything up. at the end of the last aisle  she turned around and went in the opposite direction  this time grabbing from both sides of the aisle like she had memorized everything and it’s location..“you’re an efficient shopper ” jake said as she returned to the counter..“and you are a messy stocker ” she replied. “you have your baking needs spread out all throughout this place. it should all be on one aisle  and you never put food on the same shelf as cleaning products. people are going to get clorox poisoning.”.“well  ok  then ” jake mumbled. it was no secret to anyone that there wasn’t a lot of order in his business..“where shall we eat?” she asked..“the table with the best view in the house  of course ” jake said as he started out the door. “ashley  if you need me  i’ll be upstairs.”.“ok ” ashley said. “but don’t forget i have class at three.”.“no problem. if i’m not down  just holler.”.“oh  wait ” debbie said walking back to the cooler. “i want some wine. she grabbed a bottle from the cooler and followed jake out the front and around to his house..“be careful  there’s all kind of hazards in here ” he said as he opened the door for her..“i’m sure there are ” she replied smiling..they walked in  then under  over and around the tools and material that were being used to repair the damage to the living room. right past it was a hallway with a circular metal staircase to the left that they climbed two flights up to a sun deck on the roof of his house. it had a large square framed gazebo topped by a canvas awning that shielded an outdoor dining set and wet bar from the serious southern sun..“this is nice ” she said staring out over the railing at the coast. it was early afternoon and the crosswalks across thirty-a were busy with groups  arms filled with beach necessities  walking towards the beach. passing them in the opposite direction were others going back to find shelter from the sun or more supplies..“thanks  i built it a couple of years ago when my view became the back of beachfront houses. it’s how a working man can still have the beach.”.he began unpacking the basket  laying out each item on a large round plate that he had pulled from a cabinet under the wet bar..“let’s see cheeses and crackers  fruit  olives  pita bread  prosciutto  and oreos? i had some chocolates down there that might have been better.”.“nah  the oreos just really called me ” debbie said. looking back at him over her shoulder..“well  shall we eat?”.she came to the table and sat down with him..“so  did you get your errands run?” jake asked..“yes  i went down to andrew troy’s shop and looked around and then came back up and visited eden state park.”.“so  how did you like the place?”.“which one?”.“eden  i already know what you think of trojan artifacts.”.“oh  do you now?”.“yes  i do. andy’s place is well known and respected here as the pinnacle of style  the parthenon of furnishings and he is the p.t. barnum for the rich ” he said..“alright  what is it with him?” debbie said putting down some food she had half way in her open mouth. “did he steal your girlfriend or something? or is it just plain envy?”.jake got up and opened the bottle of wine. he poured two glasses and as he handed one to her  he said  “it’s his attitude towards everything  like that old furniture he sells. he wraps it up in mystique and charges double.”.“so  why is it your concern that he might overcharge for that stuff? the people that go in and buy there  i guarantee they can afford it. it’s not like he’s stealing from the poor ” debbie said..“no  he’s not stealing from the poor  but he’s ruining paradise for a lot of people that have lived here for a long time. he and his type take what is beautiful  slaps a coat of gold paint over it and run the price to the moon. he’s taking this ” he waved his arm 180 degrees over the beach view “and turning it into trump towers.”.“jake  i’ve seen a lot of beautiful beaches all over the country  and if anything i think this place is undervalued. i mean do you know what these places would cost down in miami or connecticut or l.a.?”.“i don’t really care about those places. i moved down here twenty years ago for what it was and i don’t like where it’s going.”.“so what’s your solution  be the lone holdout in the middle of all this growth and scream from your deck  ‘no  no  no!’? you’ll just end up another marginalized activist  chip big as mt. everest on your shoulder that people point at and whisper  ‘wacko!’” she said..“i don’t know  but i’ll think of something ” he said..“well  give andrew a break and if you can’t do that  don’t rant to me about how he’s single-handedly destroying all that’s good in the world. you want to talk to me? you tell me about what’s good in the world.”.“ok  i’ll try. so  what did you think of point washington?”.“point washington?”.“yeah  eden state park.”.“oh  it’s beautiful. i was glad to finally see it ” she said taking a sip of wine..“who told you about it?” jake asked..“i read a lot about it when i was planning my trip down here.”.“you didn’t come down here looking for the fountain of youth  did you?”.“the fountain of youth?”.“yeah  people come down all the time to jump in that algae water thinking it can cure all types of things. sometimes it gets so thick with the wishful ill  you’d think it was a tent revival. you know it’s just tap water ” he said with a stare of examination that made her look away from him to the shore..“so i heard ” she said looking out at the gulf. “what was she like?”.“eden?”.“yes.”.“smart  strong willed like her mother but still foolish like a child.”.“how old was she?”.“she was nineteen.”.“she was a child ” debbie said to no one  “in american years.”.“it’s strange. people like her: beautiful  outgoing  and pure like a breeze of fire  quick to pickup almost anything-they seem to have the tragic endings. it’s the rest of us that just travel through life either winning through luck or surviving by our wits.”.“and some do neither ” debbie added  “but then  there’s always the next life.”.“the next life?” jake said  looking at the gulf. “this is the only life.”.“what are you some kind of atheist?”.“no  i’m just not particularly worried about the hereafter when i’m still trying to focus on getting this life right. besides  i was raised in a strict baptist upbringing  church and sunday school on sunday  family night on wednesday  those beliefs are too deeply drilled in me to be an atheist.”.“ah  the southern existentialist . . . life is for the living and i’m starting tomorrow.”.jake’s laugh was muffled by his wine glass..“eden’s mom would say i was a southern fatalist.”.“you two must have been involved.”.“yes  we were  but don’t tell anyone. it’s the blemish on her otherwise perfect life.”.“are you involved now?”.“no  i mean we’ve talked a lot since eden died  but she still has the same opinion of me as when she left for david.”.“david’s her husband?”.“was.”.“divorced?”.“widowed. he dropped dead of a heart attach while running down the beach.”.“she lost her husband and her child? that’s terrible.”.“well  it wasn’t really the same. he left her for a younger woman  but before the divorce was finalized he died. it was kind of ironic because instead of half of his assets  she got them all.”.“was he wealthy?”.“yes  very. he did well in destin real estate.”.“good for her. what happened to the younger girl?”.“she fought it for about a year  but didn’t really have a leg to stand on. last i heard  she moved out to northern california and decided to go fishing among all of those tech company millionaires.”.they had pretty much cleared off the plate except for the cookies. debbie picked one up  bit into it and made a strange face..“it’s the saltwater in the air  mortal enemy of hard things  especially ice and cookies ” jake said..“so  why do you sell them?” debbie asked reluctantly swallowing the bite she had already taken but putting the rest of the cookie down..“it’s a funny thing; the same people will come in three or four times to buy cookies. you know they’re getting soft on them as soon as they open the package  but they think they can make the next one work.”.“says something about human nature  don’t you think?” she asked..“i have no idea ” he replied..“so how long did you two date?”.“so  how long did you and mister earnest date?”.“about five years.”.“five years and he just asked you to marry him?”.“well  we both led pretty busy lives. plus  the first two years we weren’t exclusive.”.“weren’t exclusive? that always sounds weird to me when someone dates but they aren’t exclusive ” he said doing air quotations around the word exclusive..“didn’t you ever have any girls in your life that you were just friends with  you know  just enjoyed hanging out together?”.“i do now ” he said..she smiled at him and twirled her glass by its stem between her thumb and middle finger. the comfortable silence was broken by an advertising airplane passing down the beach dragging a banner for “all you can eat surf and turf at periwinkles”. the advertising airplane business was brisk in that area due mostly to the fact that people just didn’t watch that much tv at the beach. it could be argued as a good thing. people who had nothing but the enjoyable company of their family and friends and the sights and sounds of a lazy gulf lightly rolling on the shore would probably go into shock coming off of their vacation. the assault by the camouflaged battle cry of “buy! buy! buy!” in every day life might seem unwanted or worse unconvincing..“so  you never answered my question ” she said as the plane sailed down the sky..“we were together about ten months ” he replied looking into his glass of wine..“were you in love?”.“hell  i don’t even remember anymore. either she was the right person at the wrong time  or i was the wrong person at the right time. doesn’t really matter now  sun still shines and the bees still buzz.”.beneath them a car door slammed and tires spun in the market’s oyster shell parking lot. jake jumped up and made it to the railing just as the dust rose to their level..“not again ” he said..“what is it?”.“eden’s friends. they keep putting flowers  yellow ribbons  candles  all sorts of little mementos  trying to build a memorial for her outside my living room wall.”.“why do you care?”.“it’s bad for business. people might think this place is hexed or something if they see a bunch of stuff like that in my parking lot.”.“so they can’t show respect to her?”.“well  if they want to do that  they should go to her grave.”.“where is it?”.“over in destin  perpetual gardens something or other.”.“don’t you know?

came loose (can superglue go bad?)  primed them again  built a few roman command figures and blocked in some germanic command. while i was puttering out with that stuff i did catch a documentary on cleopatra's sister arsinoe. i like the roman civil war era (julius caesar! pompey! mark antony! octavian!) but the actual battles of of two primarily roman armies facing off aren't as interesting to me. i like asymmetric forces  so the mirror battles of legion vs legion don't stoke my enthusiasm. i've been toying with the idea of running a hypothetical ""cleopatra at war"" game  where antony and cleopatra forgo a naval battle for a land engagement against octavian. the documentary highlighted a battle i hadn't been aware of though  the battle of the nile in 47 bc. here's how it went

information on the intricacies of basing for ancient and medieval wargames  only to find that there is no single good solution to the problem. here's the deal. decades ago  wargames were designed primarily as simulations. each figure represented a certain number of soldiers  each inch of the board corresponded to a precise number of real world yards  and the bases the figures were affixed to were supposed to take up the proportional amount of area that those troops would take up on the real battlefield. during the 80's bases got standardized to fit the most popular set of rules at the time: dbm/dba. since then most of the other games that came out to compete with dbm/dba used their conventional basing for multi-figure stands since nobody wants to rebase all of their figures just to try out a new set of rules. recently several rules sets have been published that play a little looser with the sizes of multi-figure bases  either using larger or smaller bases  or getting rid of explicit base sizes altogether in favor of proportional bases sizes..i want to avoid having to rip my figures off their nicely textured bases in the future  but settling on a single type of base size has been tricky. i really like the look of very large bases  120mm x 60mm that use fewer figures and allow the miniatures ""to breath"". i've seen this referred to as ""impetus basing"" after the popular impetus rules that use it as their standard basing. i've also been reading the new hail caesar rules  and while the authors state time and again that any basing type will work  they use 40mm x 40mm bases and group several of those into units. because units need to disperse into open order (usually shown by spreading the bases apart so there is a gap between the various bases within the unit) in order to move through woods or rough ground  i think this is something i'll need to take into account. and then there's the venerable dba/dbm rules that use bases 60mm wide that are still suggested in wide range of rules..i'm pretty pysched to try out hail caesar  so currently i'm leaning towards 40x40 basing but i'm not quite settled on it. i may need to just stick the figures to temporary bases to try out the rules and see how it actually feels moving the various base sizes around during a game..posted by john at 11:37 am no comments:.email thisblogthis!share to twittershare

saxon dog,"1000 foot general: february 2017.wednesday  february 8  2017.medieval archers.this post originally appeared on the analogue hobbies painting challenge..i've had some plastic 5th edition brettonian archers knocking around my lead pile for 20 years  but didn't have a reason to get them onto the table until i started playing lion rampant. i've been working on english army circa 1250-1315 and they desperately needed a missile contingent  but the monopose brettonians didn't quite match the more dynamic modern firefroge figures that made up my the bulk of my army..doing some research over the summer i found that front rank's figures seemed to be the best match to games workshops old sculpting style  and had a variety of poses and equipment that would help break up the ranks of identical plastic brettonians..my english army uses a variety of red and yellow liveries for the knights and all of the troops they would have mustered. i don't believe soldiers would be fielding identical uniforms  as each was responsible for providing their own gear  so i'm depicting a rag tag look to these units  with some figures sporting more formal livery  while others making do with something vaguely red or yellow colored from their own meager clothing collection..to help identify the units on the table i've grouped together figures into a red unit  a yellow unit and a neutral unit. some of these figures are individually based so i can always mix the colors up if necessary  but in the end these are game pieces we need to keep track of on the table..red unit.yellow unit.neutral earth tones unit.three 16 man units give me 48 figures  which should give me a total of 240 points for the painting challenge!.posted by john at 9:36 am 6 comments:.email

painting challenge..with all of the responsibilities that come with being an adult  i haven't had a ton of time to paint over the last few weeks  but i did manage to steal a glance at this weeks theme challenge. i was pretty surprised to see it had something to do with ""homer terrain"". that was sure to be a unique set of entries  and i wracked my brain trying to figure out something that would stand out from the crowd..naturally  most entries will likely depict a terrain feature from one of homer's epic poems. there were sure to be plenty of trojan horses  gates of troy  and greek beach camps. i thought we might even see something pulled from the odyssey (maybe a cyclops cave or two?)  but i decided to go a bit farther afield. i thought i could get a more liberal interpretation of the ""homer"" theme for my terrain piece  and i considered doing fenway park  with a 28mm outfielder unable to snatch a ""homer"" as it sailed the green monster. that seemed beyond my skills though (and wouldn't really lend itself to a wargame)  but i spotted a cheap plastic knick knack depicting homer simpson as a snack food buddha. inspired by his zen-like countenance  i decided to base my terrain on the toy. a perfect start for a conversion into a mysterious jungle idol  carved by some long dead civilization of peculiar lemon colored tribesmen!.i built a small dais from wood and foamcore  and gave the whole thing a stippled coat of spackle/dry wall compound to mimic the weathered stone of the idol..a dark gray primer gave the whole piece a uniform  stone-like base to begin painting..i used a variety of grays and browns  with the faintest hints of yellow  green and pink (no doubt remnants of the festive paintjob the idol once must have sported)..""mmmmmm.... soft pretzel......"".i used numerous brown and gray washes to weather it  and added quite a bit of flock and tufts to represent the encroaching jungle foliage that will one day engulf the statue..i don't like to take all of my wargaming so seriously  and plan on using this idol for some tongue-in-cheek rogue trader or fantasy gaming. a unique subject for a unique category! altogether  i was pretty pleased at how it turned out..""none shall defile the golden emperor!"".wait.....""home"" terrain????.doh!.posted by john at 11:36 pm 12 comments:.email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to

analogue hobbies painting challenge..despite painting furiously over the last week  i still have lots of figures that aren't quite ready to be posted. i did manage to finish off some more itty bitty spaceships for star wars armada. while meager in points  i'm excited to get these finished ships onto the table..the z-95 headhunter was created for the star wars rpg back in the 80's. i believe it incorporates rejected design elements for the film's x-wings  and while it's undeniably an x-wing knock off  i've always liked the design. the z-95 has shown up in a number of games (tabletop  rpg and video) as either a second line rebel ship or in the service of various planetary defense forces  pirates or other malcontents. with a wide variety of organizations flying them each sporting their own custom paint jobs  there's a wide variety of color schemes to choose from or plenty of room to make up your own. after a cursory search i picked a style that would help distinguish these z-95s from my red squadron x-wings  but wouldn't look too out of place in service to the rebel alliance..the havoc  a heavier fighter bomber available to the rebels in armada belongs to nym  some sort of tentacle headed alien i'd never heard of. nym appears in some old clone wars era comics and video games  and in the extended star wars fiction has apparently stuck around until the rebellion era..being unfamiliar with the ship  and unwilling to do too much research  i picked a bright orange and white color scheme that showed up in nym's wookipedia entry. it's a tasty little ship on the table  and i'm pretty happy that i can field it in a flashy paint job..all told  it's a tiny entry of 7 ships but every bit counts towards that point goal  right?.posted by john at 3:14 pm 4 comments:.email

hobby time over the last few weeks preparing and running our club's first local game convention. despite a busy schedule  i managed to sneak in a bit of painting. no giant point bombs today  but at least i polished off a few more figures..i added machine guns and a new matte black finish to this 20mm scale car for gaslands. i intended to paint it in some sort of garish silver or purple  but it simply called out to be painted black in homage to the 1989 batmobile. it's hit the table a few times and has proven especially deadly!.luke skywalker has been fighting in my monday night star wars legion battles for months in a simple brown primer coat. i rushed a quick paint job on him  good enough for tabletop play and maybe a few points for the challenge..finally i finished up my collection of astropolis krogloggs. the intricate sculpts and detail warrant additional painting time which i've enjoyed  but certainly slowed my progress in the challenge..that's it for this week! four 28mm figures and a 20mm vehicle..posted by john at 1:21 pm 4 comments:.email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest.links to this post.labels: painting challenge.monday  february

our club's brain trust. renting a hall  setting up tables and putting out hot dogs doesn't really make a gaming convention though. while i may have helped set the stage  it was really our game masters and attendees who brought the event to life. based on our post-convention satisfaction surveys  and the comments we received during the convention it sounds like our little con sated a hunger for a gaming focused local event..our scrum club learned quite a bit from our inaugural event  but with one nominally successful game day completed we've already begun discussing improvements for ""the next one""..while i didn't get a chance to run or play in a game  i still had a great time chatting with attendees  welcoming some folks to their first con ever  and getting a chance to watch some very talented gms work their magic..if you attended scrum con  thank you for taking a risk on our little venture. and special thanks to the game masters who trekked in to put on a show for our players  especially buck surdu  eric schlegel  greg priebe of the hawks  kelly armstrong and neil carmichael of the army of central maryland wargaming  joey mcguire  ed watts  and our rpg hosts zeb cook  elizabeth ferrara  luke stacks  scott mckinley and keith sloan..and to the scrum team  walt  jared  rich  steve  francesco  zach  josh and joe thanks for all the hard work. you guys are really a great

eyed kroglogg aliens and managed to boot several more off my lead pile and into active duty..these chaps are labeled as ""hunters"" in the astropolis line of miniatures and act as pest control aboard the enormous star cruiser that serves as their home  but in my collection they'll pressed into service as front line troops of a rebellious alien rabble. kroglogg eyes are widely set on hammerhead shaped noggins. i assume the forward facing optical sensors on these ceremonial helmet give these particular alien soldiers binocular vision so they can act as sharpshooters for their depth perception lacking kin..in so many science fiction series the aliens are part of a monoculture devoid of individual character. all klingons are warlike. all hutts are obese gangsters. i appreciate that many of the figures in the astropolis line have individualistic characters woven into them through their sculpts..this beverage sipper looks like a cranky old fart  while the mother and child are expectedly awaiting the arrival of a loved one..our dutiful papa is enroute  lugging his work parcels with him while this dimwitted attendant barely notices his passing. love 'em!.i'm used to polishing off dozens of identical historical figures at a time  but these individual figures are requiring more attention to get right than i'm used to. my painting challenge point goal is looking increasingly overly optimistic  but i'm hoping that with just a few more individual sci fi figure to do i'll be able to drop some point bombs with mass units of uniformed figures soon..in total these 10 figures should bump me up another 50 points..posted by john at 9:55 am 5 comments:.email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest.links to this post.labels: painting challenge

dog trainer,"testimonials.search.login.menu.home.about us.testimonials.services & prices.dog faq.links.dog quotes.contact us.testimonials.**********************.""we have a now two year old australian shepard who  when we pull out his boarding bag to head to gateway  goes crazy with excitement. i can’t pull out the bag until we’re waking out the door because he gets way too excited and will push you to the car! if my dog loves gateway this much  i think that speaks volumes about the people and environment he’s in while we’re gone..before we found them  we boarded at a local place that they had to drag him into cowering because the noise level of the dogs was overwhelming. when we picked him up  he wouldn’t eat for two days. i refused to take another trip until we found a better solution. as for training  we also tried another local place that had us meet in groups with no dog interaction and little guidance or one on one. i was expected to take what i learned  and try to do my best on my own. i’m not a dog trainer and it was frustrating for all of us. when we found gateway  not only was the boarding environment completely different  they offered the training in home! when we came to pick him up after his required training time   it was amazing! they had us all come so they could teach us the skills and commands   we got a packet to take home as reference and it was the absolute best!.we have a wonderful relationship with everyone there and i can’t imagine taking our aussie anywhere else  so thankful!!"".ashley lindig.**********************.""drip is my first dog i've ever had  and i honestly had no idea what i was doing. i've read articles and books on how to train our pup and nothing was working  until gateway! we were referred by a friend who couldn't stop raving about it! my husband and i were a little hesitant to leave our boy for 2 weeks but maria was so comforting and assuring. when we got there we felt in good hands  not only are greg and maria super friendly but completely brilliant in the history and just how dogs are  down to each breed. we appreciated the time they took to thoroughly go over all of the training they had done at pick up. we have continued to board drip while we travel and we feel like he gets a vacation too while there! thank you gateway dog training for loving our dog! "".-jel.**********************.""we had to travel out of town when our golden retriever puppy was only 3 months old. we figured it was a perfect opportunity to train & board while we were away. when we returned  tanner was walking on a leash without jumping around and chewing on it. he had learned to sit  come when called  leave an object alone and more. we used gateway again just a few months later for boarding. we’ve been very pleased with the care and training that tanner has received. it’s so nice to find a place where we know he will be loved  cared for  and has fun playing with other dogs while we are gone. we will definitely continue to use gateway in the future!"".amber & chris jones.the mission of gateway dog training™ is to apply dog-friendly  force-free humane training methods to strengthen the human-dog relationship so that your pet achieves their highest potential and takes their place as a productive  well-behaved member of your family..©2007-2016 gateway dog training™  all rights reserved..terms of use | privacy statement.copyright 2020 by gateway dog training."

(bkd)  have caused most public market institutional investors to flee the private-pay seniors housing space. i don’t see a quick pivot in private-pay seniors housing because capital remains plentiful for new construction  underlying demand from older seniors (80+) is slower than it was before 2010 (see slow 80+ pop growth  elevated construction spark concern for seniors housing on this blog)  and issues at brookdale will take some time to resolve. i also believe private equity investors will await a more receptive market before bringing other quality operators public..post-acute care – post-acute care currently has more publicly traded operators with scale than private-pay seniors housing  but deteriorating operating fundamentals and high leverage have also driven public market institutional investors away from publicly-traded post-acute care operators. major reits  such as ventas (vtr) and hcp (hcp) spinning off skilled nursing assets has underlined the risks investors see in this space. increased use of medicare and medicaid managed care and ever expanding use of bundled payments are reducing lengths of stay (los)  pressuring post-acute care rates and volumes and eroding operator revenue and ebitda. however  because baby boomers are now beginning to turn 70  the pool of post-acute care patients should grow dramatically over the next 5 – 10 years while the supply of post-acute care facilities and beds is flat or declining and quality operators should be able to attract higher volumes of patients from hospitals if they care demonstrate quality outcomes. a mild flu season and high operator leverage exacerbated poor 1q16 financial performance. i anticipate pressures on rates and los stabilizing and volume growth providing upside for post-acute care operators over a 1 – 2 year period while operators are rationalizing their delivery systems and paying down debt. i believe these factors put post-acute care closer to a performance pivot point than private pay seniors housing..health care reits – health care reit share prices have been buffeted by some of the same issues affecting private pay seniors housing and post-acute care operators but health care reit share price performance has been much more mixed than that of the operators. many health care reits are well diversified  have strong lease coverage and are less exposed to overbuilding and revenue pressures than the operators themselves. health care reit stock performance is also significantly influenced by investor’s views on interest rates and overall economic growth. some healthcare reits  with more significant exposure to seniors housing or post-acute care issues  such as hcp  presumably its future spinco  and ccp  have been more directly impacted by the industry and operator issues noted above. these reits  and some others  offer larger cap  more liquid investment vehicles than seniors housing or post-acute care operators but likely also have potential for upside from the industry pivot points described above..having retired as an equity analyst who followed seniors housing  post-acute care and health care reits for 15 years  i no longer make buy  sell  hold recommendations. i do recognize that there are significant risks for private pay senior housing operators and particularly for highly leveraged post-acute care operators. however  experience in the 1999 – 2002 crash of private-pay seniors housing and post-acute care and other sell-offs driven by operating underperformance  reimbursement cuts and regulatory issues show that these sell-offs have often proven to be great investment opportunities and have absolutely been a time to look harder at these sectors and develop an investment strategy and timetable rather than to flee the space..for a more in depth discussion of these issues  listen to the senior care investor webcast by clicking on the link below. comments  including those with opposing viewpoints  welcome..share

“seniors housing” project designed to appeal to seniors as well as those of other ages looking for a high-tech  high-service environment in an urban mixed use setting. the stories opened in february 2016 and is a joint effort of federal realty investment trust and ryan frederick’s smart living 360..federal realty is a publicly traded reit (nyse: frt) that specializes in the ownership  operation  and redevelopment of high quality retail real estate in the country’s best markets and is increasingly developing mixed-use projects in connection with its retail holdings. ryan frederick has long been known as one of the leading thinkers on the future of seniors housing through his point forward solutions consulting company. ryan has now created a new company  smart living 360  to work with a retail/mixed use developer  rather than a seniors housing company or health care reit  to bring us his vision of the future of “seniors housing” in a property designed to appeal to seniors but open to those of all ages..the stories is a new 48 units apartment building located at 1628 e. jefferson street in rockville  maryland. it is part of federal realty’s congressional plaza redevelopment that includes a high-end shopping center  federal’s corporate headquarters and an existing 150+/- unit apartment building with structured parking (the crest)  now about 10 years old. the stories was developed on a site long designated for residential use as phase 2 of the crest. according to ryan  federal became interested in consciously designing the stories to appeal to the seniors market because they wanted a way to differentiate the projection from other high-end rental projects in the same area of the rockville pike  northwest of washington and bethesda..the stories is designed to appeal to the baby boomer market  now passing age 67  and other seniors with a “younger” outlook  unlikely to consider independent or assisted living or even a continuing care retirement community (ccrc). this market is large and rapidly growing and not well served by well served by conventional seniors housing. while those 75 and up are considered part of the senior housing markets in many market studies  the average entrance age for most dedicated senior housing communities is now closer to 85 than 75 (see slow 80+ pop growth  elevated construction spark concern for seniors housing on this blog – http://03c242c.netsolhost.com/wordpress/?p=209..ryan and smart living 360’s vision for the stories is derived from a view of what “younger” seniors want in a living environment to enhance their wellbeing and tries to anticipate the growing role of technology for enhancing seniors’ lifestyle and delivering the services they want and need. it is also purposefully designed to be flexible so it can adapt to the needs of its target market as they are discovered over time..to understand what federal and smart living 360 have created at the stories  you need to think outside the traditional seniors housing box regarding design  services and technology..physically  the stories is a attractive 5-story modern apartment community located in high-income  high-wealth  high-education zip code with a unit mix favoring larger 2 and 3 bedroom units (75% 2 bdrms) over one level of structured parking. with rents from $2 500 to $4 000  the stories is priced at about half the cost per square foot of traditional il properties in its market. but unlike conventional il properties  the stories does not bundle food service and activity programs into its rent. it is part of a mixed-use project including retail  office and other residential uses in a nice residential area a block off a heavily travel arterial street  the rockville pike  md 355. the property faces other residential uses and fronts on a relatively quiet suburban street..units within the stories look like high-end non-age-targeted residential rental units with small balconies that are designed with largely invisible accommodations for an aging senior market – wider doorways and master baths able to accommodate a wheel chair with higher toilets  easy entry showers  modest grab bars in the bath with studs behind the wall to allow more to be installed  roll out lower shelves in cabinets  electrical outlets further up on the wall  etc. these are accessible units that intentionally look like conventional units..common areas include a large fitness room with some specialized equipment for seniors that could also be used by personal trainers or rehab therapists  a central lounge with a refrigerator and cooking equipment and a self-serve coffee bar..there is a small conference room that is designed so that it can also be used for a visit by a health professional or for telemedicine care. the entire building is pre-wired for high speed verizon fios internet with pre-installed routers; and service providers are available to install sonos wireless speaker systems and other electronic amenities in the units. the electronics designed into the building are intended to accommodate increased use of patient self-monitoring and wellness devices that ryan believes will become increasingly prevalent  sophisticated and integrated over time..the building offers a secure electronic entry system  with an enhanced concierge called a lifestyle ambassador (services described below) manning the front desk during the day. the building is monitored in the evening by management personnel from the larger crest apartment building that is located at the other end of the block  across a parking lot from the stories. the number and length of coverage by on-site personnel is partly limited by the buildings relatively small size  only 48 units..what really sets the stories apart as a community that will appeal to seniors is its use of a lifestyle ambassador  in this case a hotel industry trained and certified concierge cross-trained in seniors housing design and services. the role of the lifestyle ambassador is threefold – 1. help residents connect with one another and with the outside community  2. provide access to any needed services  and 3. simplify resident’s lives by taking care of pets and plants while residents are traveling and providing other services. smart living 360 makes use of many off-the-shelf on-demand services  has prearranged for a wide range of additional services to be available to residents of the stories and will provide referrals to providers  including:.transportation.pharmacy.physicians.food delivery.financial advisors.case managers.home healthcare.personal trainers.tech services.the goal at the stories is to offer attractive housing  location and services to enhance the well being of baby boomers and other “younger”  generally healthy seniors without the stigma of a traditional seniors housing community with a large percentage of very old  frail people; and to do it in a flexible way that allows it residents to order in any services they may need and to adapt to rapidly evolving technology for medical monitoring and wellness..smart living 360 hopes to monitor residents of the stories over time to see if the building’s design and the flexible services it offers will enhance residents’ well being compared to those living in other residential settings. this will be done using the gallup-healthways well-being index that measures five factors:.purpose – liking what you do each day and being motivated to achieve goals.social – having supportive relationships in your life.financial – managing your economic life to reduce stress and increase security.community – liking where you live and having pride in your community.physical – having good health and enough energy to get things done..what is interesting to me about smart living 360’s approach compared to a traditional senior housing facility is that smart living 360’s life style ambassador begins with the residents’ wishes and customizes activities and services the resident desires while a traditional senior housing facility has a menu of services into which it tries to fit a resident. i see the smart living 360 approach as more resident centric  more personalized and more adaptable over time..the stories occupies an interesting place somewhere between non-age-restricted market rate apartments and conventional seniors housing. interestingly  the project was voluntarily described as 55+ housing in pre-opening marketing material but the developers have now decided to market its advantages for seniors but without the age restriction  which they believe may be a turn-off for their primary but not only target market. of the first several residents moving in  two are seniors and one is age 29 but liked the amenities..it remains to be seen whether the stories will be successful in attracting baby boomers and other seniors with a “younger” outlook and how ryan frederick’s vision of meeting residents’ needs and increased use of electronic devices to monitor and enhance health and wellness will come to pass. but i believe  even at this stage  the stories has some interesting lessons for seniors housing and multi-family developer/operators and institutional real estate investors. these include:.non-age restricted housing and un-senior “seniors housing”  as i categorize the stories  may be more appealing to under 80s seniors  and even those over 80 in good health with younger outlook  than more conventional seniors housing projects. for a significant portion of the senior population today and i believe for even a larger portion of the baby boomers  living in mixed aged neighborhoods or even in mixed age buildings like the stories may be preferable to living in a senior ghetto or in an isolated age-restricted community..we have already seen obsolescence in seniors housing communities  such as il projects without sufficient provisions for handicapped residents  il and ccrc projects without al and memory care units  al communities with insufficient common space for gyms or rehab care and il and al buildings with too many small units. this history suggests that building flexible design into seniors housing communities  which the stories has very deliberately tried to do  may be an advantage for the community over time..seniors housing located in mixed use projects or higher density urban areas  where services and amenities are close-by  while often more difficult and more expensive to develop than stand-alone conventional il or al communities  would seem to offer a lot of appeal for the baby boomer age cohort and other active seniors..in an age of on-demand services  such as uber and foodler  planning seniors housing around services delivered by outside vendors may prove both cost effective and better able to meet seniors desires and needs than the service packages typically available in seniors housing communities..seniors  particularly the baby boomer age cohort  are increasingly tech-savvy and should be able to adapt to electronic delivery of health and wellness services  as well as other on-demand services  and may see projects designed to accommodate more high-tech amenities as more appealing than conventional care models..the resident centric and holistic approach to meeting resident’s needs built into the lifestyle ambassador approach that incorporates both social and care needs  seems to offer some advantages over the way conventional seniors housing services are organized with responsibility fragmented between healthcare  activities  dining and caregiving personnel  each of whom may only see themselves responsible for a slice of a senior’s needs. while the staff in any well managed seniors housing project should get to know the “whole resident”  making resident on-demand centric services the organizing principal of your care delivery system appears to offer some advantages and a have a better chance of assuring a residents need are met..share this:.share.click to email this to a friend (opens in new window).click to print (opens in new window).click to share on linkedin (opens in new window).click

and acquaintances about seniors housing is: how do you get a reluctant family member of advanced age living alone to agree to move to seniors housing? it doesn’t seem to matter if the family member is 79 or 99  there is still a strong reluctance on the part of many of today’s seniors to move to any type of seniors housing despite objective information that such a move improves socialization  nutrition and overall health and wellness  and may increase longevity..while “how to get a reluctant family member to move?” may be the quintessential question to which families would like an answer  i find very little useful information on the web and from seniors housing organizations on how to address this question. in order to seek an answer for myself and for those who ask me about it  i interviewed a 97 year-old friend and former neighbor who made the decision to move to a ccrc about 18 months ago. i wanted to understand her decision to move  what finally convinced her to move and how her experience has been since moving to her ccrc. for the purpose of this blog  we will call her ms. f..ms. f is a remarkable person in many ways but i believe her decision to move to seniors housing and her experience after she arrived are still illustrative for others. as i indicated  ms. f is 97 years old. she moved from the large  single family home where she raised her family to a condominium in 1979  when she was only 60  partly due the health of her husband who died seven years later. she continued to live in a full-service elevator-served condominium with a wide-range of resident ages until 2014  when she made the move to a ccrc. in her condo  ms. f had occasional cleaning help but lived independently and drove. when living at her condo  ms. f attended a pilates class once a week  played 9-holes of golf regularly through 2013 and had an active social and cultural life. ms. f is college educated  cultured  very well dressed and had enough wealth so that all housing and care options were available to her..the discussion of a move to seniors housing started with ms. f’s children  the oldest of whom is 74  about three years before ms. f’s decision to move. her children  who live in another city at least six month of the year  were concerned about her living on her own and continuing to drive. ms. f indicated she finally agreed to move to a ccrc to make her children happy and because after a bout of pneumonia in the winter of 2013 she did not bounce back completely to her previous stamina. the discussions for her to move also began after her significant-other  with whom she had a very long-term relationship  died..ms. f’s reluctance to move to a ccrc or another type of seniors housing primarily arose from the fact that moving to such a facility would require her to “admit she was old”  something she had never really done despite being 95 at the time of her move. ms. f  like many in the current generation of roaring twenties babies in their 80s and 90s  also saw moving to seniors housing in a negative light because it indicated to her that she could no longer live on her own and she saw it as giving up some of her independence..one of the key lessons i took from ms. f’s experience is that us baby boomers  the children of today’s 80 and 90 year-olds  tend to see their parents as very old  frail people in need of care while many seniors do not view themselves as old and cherish their independence. this suggests that any conversation about a move to seniors housing should not begin with the senior’s frailties but how such a move could enhance and prolong independence. it would be better for us boomers to approach these discussions thinking about the attributes of senior housing that we would find attractive because a seniors’ view of him or her self  if still healthy and not cognitively impaired  sees 80 or even 90 as the new 60..the other clear lesson from ms. f’s experience  and that of other seniors and their families that i have observed  is that the decision to move to seniors housing  if made voluntarily  is often a prolonged process that can stretch to a year or more. it is also important to realize that senior housing facilities offer a broad range of housing and lifestyle choices and may involve trade-offs between housing and lifestyle amenities  something that seniors and  in many cases  their children may not understand. visits and short-term stays  which many facilities offer  can help a senior and their families get to know a facility well before committing to move..it is also worth noting that a mixed-age full-service condominium served ms. f very well as a housing choice for 35 years  from the time she was 60 until she was 95. with the growing availability of smart-phone accessed transportation  grocery and food delivery and home care services  it is important for the seniors housing industry to realize that well-designed  mixed-age apartments and condominiums can be a very viable option for many seniors and that seniors may prefer such options that don’t require them to “admit they are old”..ms. f and her family did not undertake an exhaustive search of senior housing facilities because they were looking for something high-end and were familiar with many of the choices because ms. f  at 95  knew people living at a number of the likely choices. the facility ms. f chose was relatively close to her condominium  offered extensive educational and cultural programming  which appealed to her  and had friendly and welcoming staff. the downside of the community ms. f chose was that it dates from 1984 and did not offer some of the amenities within its units and common areas of other facilities that were newer or which had undergone extensive renovations. ms. f looked at a number of different units before she found one on an upper floor that had enough natural light to make it appealing. ms. f moved from a modern three-bedroom  two-bath condo with larger windows and lots of light to an oversized one-bedroom  one-bath senior housing unit. she believes the size of the unit is fine but would prefer a larger bath and a separate powder room for when she has quests. ms. f’s focus on a welcoming staff  light in units and other factors dovetail well with industry studies of independent living customer satisfaction. (see my blog on finding happiness in seniors housing http://03c242c.netsolhost.com/wordpress/2015/08/20/finding-happiness-in-senior-housing/)..it is worth noting that the ccrc to which ms. f moved is about to undertake a major expansion and renovation that will add larger independent living apartments in response to demand  add a memory care section and renovate public areas to update the look and add casual café-style dining in addition to the formal dining room..ms. f’s transition to a ccrc has been relatively easy for her. she only knew one person well at the ccrc when she moved but ms. f was able to make friends quickly. today ms. f gets around without a walker but does worry about falling and is careful when she walks. ms. f was still driving at the time she moved to a ccrc but not long after she arrived she had a minor traffic accident and decided to give up driving. however  using the ccrcs and private transportation services  ms. f still gets to her pilates class once a week and to cultural events (she will be traveling to new york soon to see hamilton) and she has added personal fitness training at the ccrc and is attending many of the programs that the facility offers  including a current lecture series on the supreme court planned before justice scalia’s death..i believe ms. f’s attitude toward her move to a ccrc also eased her transition. rather than focus on the space she was giving up and the things she was leaving behind  ms. f chose to view her move as an opportunity. she got help from a decorator to design and furnish her new home  bought some new things and recovered some of the furniture she chose to move from her condominium. so she made it a new beginning rather than a move down..ms. f is very positive on her ccrc now that she has moved and agrees that she may have benefitted from moving sooner. but ms. f doubts she could have made the decision to move until she started to notice herself slowing down following her pneumonia  had lost her significant other and was ready to admit she was old. one of the benefits she sees at the ccrc is knowing other couples that are older than her but still mentally active and able to get around. her close friends at the facility include a couple that are 102 and  while he uses a walker  are still in very good health and very alert..top on ms. f’s list of what makes her ccrc a good place to live are:.activities/programming – special events (st. patrick’s day and easter dinners for example)  movies including first run movies such as spotlight and brooklyn  lectures that cost residents $25 and outsiders $125  religious services  entertainment every wednesday and other events like a forum for local mayoral candidates..volunteer opportunities.in-house exercise programs and therapy.housekeeping services that include weekly linen service  biweekly cleaning and an annual complete unit cleaning as part of the base rate and pal service that for $21 per hour provide additional light cleaning  laundry and making the bed..friendly staff who know you by name and friendly residents. many of the staff are african american high school students interested in careers in healthcare or food service/hospitality industry that the facility trains..someone looking out for you – it is comforting knowing there is always someone there for you. the facility has an electronic monitoring system that can tell if you are not up moving around your unit by a certain time and uses other checks such as attending meals and taking in your paper to check to be sure you are all right  as well as emergency alert system..a healthy future – ms. f can see that she is not the oldest and certainly healthier than some others..share this:.share.click to email this to a friend (opens in

private sector  primarily in equity research and investment banking for publicly traded securities firms. i  like many with private sector careers and nearly everyone even slightly right of center politically  take as an article of faith that the private sector is more efficient than the government at doing just about anything. however  when it comes to social security and medicare (technically the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms) my experience over the past year indicates these agencies far exceed private sector insurers in quality of service..in a single week in january 2016  i applied for social security  my wife applied for medicare and my wife interacted over a billing issue with carefirst  the maryland blue cross / blue shield company. these interactions highlighted for me the contrasts between dealing with these two federal government agencies and dealing with a private sector health insurer. i found the difference in quality in the government’s favor to be so dramatic that i thought it warranted a comment on my blog..the quality differences with social security  medicare and private insurers start online. the ssa.gov and medicare.gov websites are well designed and easy to negotiate and the online process to apply for social security and medicare are clear  easy to understand and complete. follow up correspondence from the agencies can be couched in bureaucratic language but is timely  understandable and alerts you and your spouse to possible benefits  like social security if one of you signs up for medicare  help paying for drugs or the availability of spousal benefits..after i recently filed online for social security benefits the agency had some questions. i was contacted via email by an agency employee within 48 hours of filing my application for benefits and asked to set up a time to talk. i received a call back from a claims specialist within the time slot to which we had agreed. she was very pleasant and enthusiastic  was able to resolve the questions she had and indicated she would move my application along with formal notification likely coming closer to the month in which my 66th birthday would occur. she clearly disclosed that the detailed guidelines for staff of social security changes included in the recently passed budget bill had not yet been prepared but agreed that may 1 was the deadline  which i had met  for various rules changes. in short  both my online and telephone interaction with a social security claims specialist were easy and pleasant and i believe they will prove effective..my wife’s experience with medicare and carefirst involved only online experiences. with medicare she was able to quickly and easily complete her medicare application and has already received her notice of eligibility with coverage beginning in the month she will turn 65. she has yet to select part b and part d providers  which will be private insurers operating within medicare requirements. contrast this with her almost simultaneous online interaction with carefirst  which has provided one or both of us with individual health insurance coverage for the last five years or so..in january  our credit charge used to automatically pay my wife’s carefirst monthly premium had some information change  so the automatic payment of her carefirst premium had not gone through. this was communicated to her with conflicting emails  one auto-generated indicating the payment had been processed and another saying it had been rejected and she risk losing coverage if payment was not received. this led us to the carefirst website  where we spent 10 – 15 minutes trying to find the right area to update the payment information and then another frustrating 15 minutes plus because the system would not allow us to update the information on the credit card. we finally realized we had to first delete the exist card on file for automatic payments and then enter the same card with updated information. but nowhere was this explained in instructions or in the repeated message that the system was unable to update the card on file..we have previously had equally or more frustrating experiences with carefirst online  over the phone and even going to an office and dealing with a person face to face when we initially tried to sign up for individual policies (pre affordable care act exchanges) and when i shifted from our joint policy to medicare and we tried to keep coverage in place for my wife. the letter we received from carefirst indicating we had first been approved for individual health insurance policies was so badly written that neither of us  despite two sets of graduate degrees  were able to understand it. it was only when we received a bill that we realized coverage had been approved. after going to a carefirst office in person to remove me from our carefirst coverage when i switched to medicare but leave coverage in place for my wife  the company still miss-handled the conversion and my wife had to have a number of phone calls with the company before she was able to get her coverage continued. lest you think this is only an issue with carefirst  i have also found medicare.gov much easier to negotiate than the websites of united healthcare for medicare supplemental insurance and websites of medicare part d drug coverage providers..so  for seniors and their family members  take heart. our experience indicates that social security and medicare are much easier to deal with than your current private insurer. kudos to the dedicated employees working at the social security administration and the centers for medicare and medicaid services and keep up the good work. america’s seniors need you..for all of us as citizens  we need to admit there are times when government works and may even work better than the private sector – despite what you will hear during this presidential election year. and before you say it – the cost to operate social security and medicare is also lower on a percentage basis than the cost to provide private insurance..share this:.share.click to email this to a friend (opens in new window).click to

medicare & social security | 2 comments ».beware of observation status at hospitals.by jdoctrow posted: wednesday  12/2/2015.the affordable care act includes a number of measures intended to rein in unnecessary or wasteful spending by medicare. these are generally grouped under the label “value-based purchasing”. one key element of value-based purchasing are penalties for hospitals that have high levels of readmissions after discharge that went into effect in 2012. the penalties  which gradually ramp up to 3% of inpatient medicare reimbursement to a hospital  are designed as an incentive for hospitals to provide quality care while in the hospital and to assure that the patient is provided with a smooth handoff to quality post-acute care after a hospital visit..hospital readmissions are down significantly since excessive readmission penalties have come into effect but according to an article in the wall street journal on december 2  2015 entitled “u.s. rules reshape hospital admissions” http://www.wsj.com/articles/medicare-rules-reshape-hospital-admissions-1449024342 the new rules have also prompted hospitals to reclassify many more hospital visits as “observations” rather than “admissions”. in most cases  a stay of even a few days may be classified as “observation” rather than an inpatient “admission” and a patient can be on “observation” status even though given a room. medicare treats “observation” visits as lower cost outpatient treatment and they do not trigger a readmission penalty because they don’t count as an admission or readmission..so if you or your loved one is cared for in a hospital on “observation” status rather than as an inpatient “admission”  gets a room and receives the same level of care  why should you care about how the hospital classifies the visit? the big risk for a patient and patient’s family in an observation visit is that medicare does not treat an observation visit as a three-day hospital stay that triggers medicare payments for post-acute care. as a result  a patient treated for three or four days in a hospital on “observation” status who then needs rehabilitation care or time to recover in a skilled nursing facility would be fully responsible for these costs rather than medicare fully paying for up to 20 days of skilled nursing care and partially paying for up to 100 days of skilled nursing care if the patient needs that much care and is still making progress toward recovery. the wsj article cites families being on the hook for $20 000 of skilled nursing care because a hospital classified a four-day visit as “observation” rather than an inpatient “admission”..i would urge any patient or family of a patient to strongly advocate to be formally admitted to a hospital for any serious injury or condition and to use right to appeal to medicare if you or your loved one is not admitted or is admitted but is being discharged in less than three days to skilled nursing care. it is unfortunate that the stress of any hospital visit for a patient or a loved one needs to be further complicated by worrying about “observation” vs. “admission” status but the downstream costs can be dramatically higher for one vs. the other..share this:.share.click to email this to a friend (opens in new window).click to print (opens in new window).click to share on linkedin (opens in new window).click to

vacationed in barcelona and the basque region of spain in october 2015. we had previously visited madrid.placa de catalunya in barcelona.and southern spain but had never before been to the northern part of the country. our itinerary took us directly to barcelona  where we spent three days  followed by five days in san sebastian and another two days back in barcelona before flying home. we planned the trip and traveled on our own without any difficulty..logistics – if you live in baltimore  or its northern suburbs  flying internationally from philadelphia can be an attractive alternative. the philadelphia airport is only 93 miles from my home in baltimore and  while further away than either baltimore washington international airport (26 miles) or dulles (65 miles)  offers many more international flights than bwi and  if you time it right  is an easier drive than dulles. it also happens to offer a direct flight to barcelona  which dulles did not. at the philadelphia airport  since we don’t know the facility well  we pre-booked parking at preflight  which offers both indoor and outdoor parking options and quick shuttle service to the terminal..our hotel in barcelona was in the city center  a 30 to 45 minute drive from the airport. for our arriving flight we pre-booked a car service online for 39 euros  which was only a bit more than the 33 – 35 euro for the taxis we used for our other trips. while many guide books recommend train travel in spain  which is fast and efficient  a friend with relatives in san sebastian recommended we fly from barcelona to the basque region  which only takes an hour and is cheaper than the train. we flew vueling  a discount airline active in spain  from barcelona to san sebastian for about $94 per person each way  paying a bit extra for preferred seating and the ability to check luggage. the plane was a modern airbus and flights were fine. the san sebastian airport is about half an hour from san sebastian in hondarribia and there are only a few flights per day. another alternative is to fly to bilbao  which has more flights but is about an hour drive from san sebastian  or to fly to biarritz in france  which is actually slightly closer to san sebastian than bilbao airport. on the ride from the san sebastian airport to our hotel  the cab  which did not have a meter  over charged us by about 10 euros. the proper fare should be about 33 euros..barcelona – is a city of 1.7 million people  the second largest in spain  and is the capital city of the autonomous community of catalonia. locals prefer to speak catalan rather than spanish but understand both and most also speak some english. barcelona is a charming  very walkable city with wonderful food  shopping and architecture. the city is organized by neighborhoods  with the two most important for tourists being barri gotic (the old walled city or gothic quarter) and eixample  the fashionable district north of barri gotic with amazing art nouveau / modernisme architecture (as the catalans call it). these districts are linked by placa de catalunya  a main square in an area with many tourist hotels. we stayed in el born  which adjoins barri gotic and also has small lanes  lots of shops  restaurants and bars  the picasso museum and the large citadel park..we felt very safe in barcelona  even when out late on the street. the guidebooks all caution you about pickpockets in barcelona and we did take precautions for this using money belts  anti-theft purses and bags and keeping my wallet in my front pocket with two rubber bands so it could not be easily removed. but we never saw or noticed a pickpocket incident..we really enjoyed barcelona. the city itself and its architecture and food are the main attractions. most guide books suggest you start with las ramblas  a street with a wide pedestrian-only median that runs along the edge of barri gotic on the line that was the former old city wall. this walk gives you a glimpse of the people  the lower edge of eixample if you start at placa de catalunya  and the barri gotic but is increasingly filled with chain stores and tourists so not the most interesting perspectives on the city. we much preferred strolling through the windy lanes of barri gotic where more local shops  restaurants and many historic sites  including the main cathedral  are located. eixample and areas north house the modernisme architectural gems of barcelona  which include:.la sagrada familia.la sagrada familia church  which is one of the largest and most magnificent religious buildings and architectural achievements anywhere. started in 1882  it blends some gothic elements with the modernisme style of antoni gaudi. be sure to book timed tickets in advance and  if you can  try to come in later in the day when the sun streams through the stained glass windows (see photo). we did this by accident and were delighted we did..park guell  also designed by gaudi  which started as an exclusive residential development on a high point north of the city  and has evolved into a park featuring fanciful designs and landscaping highlighting the modernisme style. timed tickets purchased in advance also a must here..casa mila  a gaudi designed apartment apartment building whose interior courtyard  attic  roof and top floor apartment are open to the public while the rest of the building remains a fashionable.casa mila.barcelona residential address. you can view the exterior for free but the paid tour including the former owners apartments was well worth the price of admission for us. timed ticked in advance essential..block of discord  which features three prime examples of modernisme architecture designed by gaudi and two other modernisme architects. while one of these building is open for tour  viewing the facades for free from the street is probably sufficient here  particularly if you tour casa mila..sculpture at fundacio miro.we found two art museums to be really special  the picasso museum and the fundacio joan miro. collections in both were created with works donated by the artists and their families and both present a broad range of work from the artists student days  in some cases  to very late in life. the picasso museum is more centrally located in three interconnected historic buildings in el born  just outside barri gotic. advance reservations are a must for the picasso museum to avoid long waits and this museum has the stronger collection of the two. we would rate it a must-see for anyone with even a mild interest in art and it explains the historic and cultural influences influencing picasso’s various periods. the fundacio joan miro is located in a modern building on montjuic  a tall hill west of the city center. in addition to a strong miro collection  fundacio joan miro has temporary exhibits by contemporary artists. we found the audio guides temperamental and the directional signage and organization of the building a bit confusing but still well worth a visit..we ate some great meals in barcelona and particularly enjoyed two restaurants in el born  near our hotel – llamber and saboc..basque region – the basque region includes parts of spain and france where the two countries meet on the atlantic.la concha beach in san sebastian.ocean. the basque people have a long history  a distinct language and culture and are know for excellent cuisine. we stayed in san sebastian  which is a very attractive modest-size waterfront resort with an charming old town. we really enjoyed san sebastian  with walks along the beach and the two hills that frame the main beach and harbor  exploring pintxo bars in the old town and shopping. biarritz in france offers a more upscale beachfront option and st-jean-de-luz in france and hondarribia in spain both offer smaller  more intimate places to stay and all are within an hours drive of san sebastian..for food in san sebastian  we mostly relied on pintxo bars  finding the full  multi-course spanish lunches too heavy for us. favorite pintxo bars included la cepa  and taverna gandarias. we also have a very good full lunches at branka  which overlooks concha beach in san sebastian and at txoko in getaria overlooking the harbor  where we had a memorable white and green asparagus salad and terrific grilled fish..guggenheim museum.the basque region of spain and france offers hilly  very green scenery  like ireland or the pacific northwest in the us  great beaches and wonderful food. we hired a guide and driver in san sebastian online for visits to see the guggenheim museum in bilbao  the coastal towns of geteria and zumaia in spain and the french basque region. our guide was very good and we we would recommend basque tours (info@basquetours.com). the guggenheim museum in is an amazing architectural work that we thought worked less than ideally as a art museum but absolutely worth a visit. we also enjoyed visiting the french basque region  which offers from dramatic scenery and charming towns. we particularly liked st-jean-de-luz which we visited on market day and where we shopped in small stores on a pedestrian-only street..share this:.share.click to email this to a friend (opens in new window).click to print (opens in new window).click to share on linkedin (opens in new window).click to share on

report in today’s (10/29/15) wall street journal on page c1  the two-year budget agreement  passed by the house of representatives on october 28th and headed to the senate  will eliminate the ability of social security recipients to elect and suspend benefits at age 66 and have their spouse claim spousal benefits while the primary recipient with suspended benefits continues to increase their ultimate payment by delaying their own social security benefits until age 70. this strategy is described in books such as get what’s yours – the secrets to maxing out your social security and in my blog post on may 27  2015 with the same title. the change is scheduled to go into effect six months after the budget bill becomes law  after which social security will not longer allow family members to submit a new claim for spousal benefits on a suspended benefit. so there may still be a small window for couples where both spouses will be 66 within the next six months to utilize this benefit..share this:.share.click to email this to a friend (opens in new window).click to print (opens in new window).click to share on linkedin (opens in new window).click to share on facebook (opens

evaluating healthcare reits  senior housing and post-acute care companies  i decided to focus my blog on broader senior housing and care issues for individuals and companies  rather than recommending stocks or investment products. i intend to stick with this approach but want to make readers of my blog aware of a recently released white paper from stifel nicolaus’s equity compass strategies funds management group. the white paper is entitled rethinking traditional retirement income and i found it to be a concise  well-written discussion of the tradeoffs between using the traditional 4% withdrawal rate for retirement planning and a 60%/40% equity to fixed income investment split for retirement savings. i have no financial relationship to the equity compass strategies group at stifel. you can access the white paper at.http://www.equitycompass.com/pdf/equity%20compass%20whitepaper_final.pdf.share this:.share.click to email this to a friend (opens in new window).click to print (opens

jdoctrow posted: friday  10/2/2015.the national investment center for seniors housing and care (nic) http://www.nic.org held its 25th national conference this week at the gaylord national harbor  just south of washington. i attended the first nic conference  which was a much smaller affair at a hotel in crystal city  also just south of washington but on the virginia side of the potomac. having spent much of my career in seniors housing and care as a real estate analyst  stock analyst  investment banker and now occasional consultant  it was very gratifying to see how much the industry has grown and matured in 25 years..my only official role at the conference was to address the future leader’s council (flc)  which is a carefully selected group that goes through three years of nic leadership development activities before “graduating”  with a third of the group rotating each year. i was impressed with the flc members with whom i interacted and with the thoughtful way nic is helping talented professionals grow into leadership roles at their organizations and in the industry..my address to the flc group was entitled “back to the future” and focused on lessons learned about the impacts of overbuilding and higher interest rates in the severe 1999/2000 industry downturn. most flc members were still in primary or secondary school when this downturned occurred..i would say the overall atmosphere of the industry at nic’s 25th national conference was “nervous optimism”..the nervousness comes from:.generally unsettled economic conditions in the u.s. and around the world that could lead to higher interest rates and growing wage pressures on an industry for which labor is 50% or more of costs .recent softness in private-pay senior housing occupancy .a increase in the number of units being developed (particularly assisted living and memory care) and signs of overbuilding in select markets .integration stumbles at the largest and largest publicly traded senior housing operator  brookdale senior living (bkd) .some signs of a plateau in senior housing property capitalization rates and pricing .a late summer sell off in healthcare reits and generally unsettled conditions in the equity and debt markets  which appear to be driving the pause or potentially a backup in cap rate compression..the optimism comes from:.a 15 year rebound in fundamentals from the last major industry downturn .generally outperforming other real estate sectors through the great recession .still strong consumer acceptance of newly open properties  particularly in high barrier to entry markets .plentiful availability and still growing interest in the industry from both debt and equity capital providers  if perhaps at higher prices that were seen a year ago .knowing that the industry continues to get closer to the holy grail of 75m + baby boomers becoming seniors housing and care customers (although still 10 – 15 years away)..unless you are concerned about substantial overbuilding in private-pay seniors housing  which most thoughtful insiders are not (there will be some)  the recent pullback in both healthcare reit and operator pricing is making me more interested in investing in publicly traded healthcare reits and private pay operators but there are few publicly traded operators to buy. on the care side of seniors housing and care  there has also been a pull back that makes skilled nursing and post acute care company stocks attractive from a valuation standpoint. here  however  the slow evolution of a more integrated healthcare delivery system and new value-base purchasing and an uncertain political situation through the next presidential election may keep a lid on valuations for another year or two. either way  it feels like a time to be considering investments in seniors housing and care for the long term investor. i will leave it to those still working as equity analysts in the space to recommend specific stocks..there are also signs at the conference that innovations in technology  property location and design are alive and well. at least two efforts are underway to develop new senior housing properties in manhattan. the most interesting new building model i saw at the conference is a mid-rise product located in an urban main street location that looks more like an upscale yuppie rental project or w hotel  with services delivered on demand by the likes of uber  amazon fresh and online home health providers. this project is being developed by smart living 360 and federal realty trust (frt) in rockville  md and is scheduled to open in the spring of 2016. see website http://www.thestories.com/ for more information..share this:.share.click to email this to a friend (opens in new window).click to print

this could be a solid pairing if that happens..graham rahal (no. 15): this year will represent a season of change for graham as he moves to his father's team at rahal letterman lanigan racing from ganassi b  and swaps the no. 15 with his old 38. the two rahals never formed a partnership previously  as graham decided he wanted to establish his career on his own terms. he's done that  and is now comfortable with being a member of the family business. i never thought he (or charlie kimball for that matter) got a fair shake with ganassi b and now that he is the lead driver on a team he is primed to have the breakout season most of us have been expecting from him. hard to believe he is still just 24..james jakes (no. 16): jakes takes his considerable family fortune to rahal letterman lanigan racing this year in a move that surprised many  including me. he was second to last in points among drivers who competed in every race last year (ahead of simona de silvestro  but at least she had an excuse) and has finished p22 in points in both of his indycar seasons. expect more of the same this year..mike conway (no. 17): depending on your perspective  conway did the admirable thing or the cowardly thing when he walked away from his aj foyt ride just before fontana last season  saying he just no longer wanted to compete on ovals. i like mike  so i'm going with the former here  and back in september i predicted that he'd probably be able to find someone who could fit him into a twistie package because he is so good at them. rll did just that  and conway will be in the field at least at long beach  where he won driving for andretti autosport in 2011..ana beatriz (no. 18): in what many would call a last-minute move -- but one that is actually ahead of schedule since dale coyne is involved -- bia gets the opportunity to return to the indycar series after starting 22 races over the previous three seasons. there is talk that she will at some point or another share the ride with stefan wilson  who also tested the car at barber last week  but for now it is her seat for st. pete  sao paulo and the ovals  and she looks to improve on her 14th-place finish at st. pete two years ago..justin wilson (no. 19): looking back at justin's 2012  i have a hard time believing that he finished p15 in the standings. from the eye test  it just looked better than that  especially on ovals  where he took a big step forward  running up front at indy before finishing p7  winning at texas and qualifying second at milwaukee. still  his team chased a lot of mechanical issues all season long  and therein lies the problem. from 2009-11 he finished p11  p9 and p11 in the standings  which is more like it. anything outside of the top 10 in points should be a disappointment to this crew..ed carpenter (no. 20): it's crazy to think for as good as ed is on ovals (and he is very good)  he's just as terrible on the twisties. i think if his fuzzy's vodka team put a little more effort into the road/street side of the program he would be much improved  but they are an oval team and don't make any apologies about that. nor should they. if you want a solid lock for 2013  you can give a win to ed in one of the triple crown races (indy  pocono or fontana)  because those three races will be very near and dear to his heart..oriol servia (no. 22): i don't know what it is that makes me think this guy is so awesome (maybe it is the way he trills his ""r's"" or something) but i do. servia is a lot of fun to watch because when he has a hooked up race car he makes it go. i'm sure it's a point of pride that at one point in the season the spaniard had passed more cars than anyone in the series  but at the same time that was a necessity  the result of some really poor qualifying efforts. with the competition so tight from top to bottom  you really need a lot of luck if you are starting mid-pack  especially at a road or street course. they need to be better on fridays and saturdays this season..marco andretti (no. 25): have some off-season attitude adjustments (not to mention a car number change) going to cure what ills the third-generation driver? that remains to be seen  but last year was just putrid for marco  and a huge step back in his career. three top 10s (and the pole at fontana) and a great run at indy until a late race crash was all he had to show for 2012  which doesn't get it done. many are picking him as a favorite to win indy  and if the numbers follow suit  it could happen. his previous two horrible finishes at indy (p24 in 2007 and p30 in 2009) were followed by podiums the next season. he finished p24 last may  could another bounce back be coming?.james hinchcliffe (no. 27): through milwaukee last year  hinch was on fire  picking up a podium at long beach  a front row start at indy and a podium at milwaukee  to go along with seven finishes of p6 or better in eight races. but a crash at iowa sent him into a tailspin from which he was unable to recover  finishing p12 or worse in six of the last seven events. if the barber test is any indication  hinch wasn't any worse for the wear as he battled for the top spot on the pylon in each session. like jr hildebrand  hinch is relatively inexperienced with just 31 indycar starts  but given his talent and the resources at his disposal  he will rise pretty quickly. don't be surprised to see him break into the win column this season  and a top 5 in points isn't out of the question..tristan vautier (no. 55): what's with this huge jump in car numbers? oh well  the double nickel will be on the side of the 23-year-old frenchman's ride this year  and look for him to easily roll to rookie of the year honors. ok  so he's the only driver in the running for the award  but given his pedigree it's a safe bet he would have been regardless of the size of the field. back-to-back titles in star mazada (2011) and indy lights (2012) convinced sam schmidt to give him a shot at the big leagues this season. the key word for this young driver: patience. not just from his perspective  but ours too. he will make his share of mistakes  but improvement should follow..josef newgarden (no. 67): a year ago  much of what was written above could have been written about newgarden. young and with a ton of talent  josef took his lumps last year as he figured out what racing at this level is all about. year 2 should be much better  if he can begin finishing races and consistently running in the top 10  you can call it a success. you can say the same for many of the young drivers in this series  but once it clicks  watch out. his sarah fisher hartman racing team has really stepped up its game  and resources  the last couple of seasons  so everything is in place for young newgarden to take a big jump up the pylon..simon pagenaud (no. 77): simon was a nice surprise in a lot of ways last year. despite being disadvantaged as a single-car entry  pagenaud rolled to a p5 finish in points  posting three podiums and showing he was a quick study on ovals  a discipline on which he had never raced prior to arriving at indy last year. he is on everyone's list to win a race this year (including mine)  and with a teammate in vautier he has another resource to gather information  which should only add to his chances. he is by far the best driver who doesn't work for ganassi  andretti or penske..simona de silvestro (no. 78): time to bring back the simona! moniker when talking about de silvestro  who has been a complete professional in dealing with the heaps of crap that have been thrown her way the last couple of years. now with a teammate in tony kanaan for the first time and a chevy engine compliments of her new team in kv racing  it's simona's opportunity to show she is capable of doing what we think she can. but on the flip side  now it's time for her to show what she can do...and the pressure that comes with that. two years ago she started 2011 with a p4 at st. pete and a p9 at barber  then saw her career stall after a couple of accidents later that year and then the (s)lotus engine that made last year pretty much a waste. can she get back to what we saw at the start of 2011? she has what she needs at her disposal now..charlie kimball (no. 83): kimball was another driver that had a roller coaster year in 2012. through belle isle  kimball had ridden to four finishes of p8 or better  then drove the wheels off of the car to pick up his first career podium in the form of a p2 at toronto. in between were seven finishes of 18th or worse. kimball is very fortunate to have a supportive sponsor in novo nordisk  but as i mentioned about graham rahal  doesn't seem to get as much help with ganassi b as he should. i don't think kimball is ever going to be a superstar by any means  but he has the stuff to be a solid driver in the right situation. even where he is now  he should finish better than his p19 finish in the standings from a year ago..alex tagliani (no. 98): one of the other benefits of writing this in car number order is that i get to end with tags  who is probably just a step or two below tony kanaan in pure on (and off) track entertainment  and drives from one of the teams that best engages social media in the series. so if from all of that you feel like you are friends with alex despite never meeting him  don't fret...i do too. anyway  like all teams saddled with the lotus last year  he got off to a dreadful start that was so bad that his bryan herta autosport team didn't even make the trip to brazil for the sao paulo race. but once with the chevy  their season took off and he became a top 10 machine  posting eight of them through the final 10 races. he is one of those streaky drivers that can put together a couple of poles and be a threat to win a race at any time. and believe it or not  this weekend will represent the start of his 14th year in american open wheel racing..ok  so my summary of the drivers is in the book. what's next? predictions of course! check back here soon for my thoughts as to how the season is going to go down..posted by mike knapp at 5:49 pm.email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest.no comments:.post a comment.newer post older post home.subscribe to: post comments (atom).follow by email.blog archive.jun 2020 (1).dec 2019 (2).nov 2019 (2).nov 2018 (2).oct 2018 (2).may 2018 (2).nov 2017 (1).jun 2017 (1).may 2017 (1).apr 2017 (2).mar 2017 (6).jan 2017 (1).dec 2016 (1).jun 2016 (1).may 2016 (2).apr 2016 (4).mar 2016 (1).feb 2016 (1).aug 2015 (2).jul 2015 (3).may 2015 (6).apr 2015 (1).feb 2015 (2).nov 2014 (1).oct 2014 (1).sep 2014 (2).aug 2014 (1).jul 2014 (3).may 2014 (6).apr 2014 (2).mar 2014 (5).nov 2013 (2).oct 2013 (1).sep 2013 (1).jun 2013 (3).may 2013 (6).apr 2013 (4).mar 2013 (7).feb 2013 (5).jan 2013 (3).dec 2012 (3).nov 2012 (4).oct 2012 (7).sep 2012 (9).aug 2012 (5).jul 2012 (8).jun 2012 (13).may 2012 (29).apr 2012 (14).mar 2012 (18).feb 2012 (13).jan 2012 (7).dec 2011 (3).nov 2011 (6).oct 2011 (4).sep 2011 (4).jul 2011 (2).jun 2011 (2).apr 2011 (4).mar 2011 (5).feb 2011 (11).jan 2011 (18).dec 2010 (25).popular posts.tony george needs to go away.a perspective.karting in dubai!.checking out my local track.annnndddd...we have a schedule!.awesome inc. theme. powered by blogger.."

wooden slab,turkish ‘pide’ is like pizza  only better - by elizabeth taviloglu.sign in.sign up.luminaries.what's new.invite friends.sign in.sign up.turkish ‘pide’ is like pizza  only better.by elizabeth taviloglu.published: mar 31  2014 08:55 pm gmt /.updated: mar 31  2014 09:27 pm gmt.i have been a pizza lover since i was a child. i’ve eaten pizza in new york  chicago and all over the usa. i’ve eaten it in italy and france and the u.k.  too..i’ve had every kind of pizza from gourmet to frozen to home delivery-style. after all these years of enjoying pizza  i’ve found a new love. it’s turkey’s version of pizza  called ‘pide’ (pee-deh’)..all the elements are the same as the italian-inspired pizzas we know so well. soft   fresh dough that’s crunch on the outside and fluffy white and yeasty on the inside  delicious cheese and toppings all baked to perfection on a wooden slab..so what makes turkish ‘pide’ so different and delicious? first and foremost  it’s the cheese. ‘pide’ comes from the black sea region of turkey that’s famous for it’s rich cheeses and dairy products. only a special kashar cheese from the coastal city of trabzon is used for making ‘pide.’.secondly  the toppings are slightly different. there is no tomato sauce on turkish ‘pide.’ the cheese is spread directly on the dough. then different toppings are used over the cheese  like bits of lamb  ground beef  vegetables like peppers and spinach..often  folks will ask to have an egg cracked on top  too. and some varieties have no cheese at all. only meat  veggies and herbs. melted butter is drizzled or brushed over the dough. need i say more?.go ahead and pass up classic pizza for once and give turkish ‘pide’ a try. like me  you’ll fall in love..photo © elizabeth taviloglu  2013.more from elizabeth taviloglu.advertisement.getting started.invite others.create.about.about.contact.resources.help.terms.privacy policy.reporting copyright violations.©2020 eluminary llc. all rights reserved..luminaries.what's new.
