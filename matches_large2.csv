way to find these opportunities is not through online job boards  the classifieds  or employment agencies—it’s by talking to people around you. your network of friends  relatives  colleagues  and acquaintances is a valuable job search resource. networking may sound intimidating  but it can be rewarding and fun  even if you’re shy or feel like you don’t know many people.what is networking?.the vast majority of job openings are never advertised; they’re filled by word of mouth. that’s why networking is the best way to find a job. unfortunately  many job seekers are hesitant to take advantage of networking because they’re afraid of being seen as pushy  annoying  or self-serving. but networking isn’t about using other people or aggressively promoting yourself—it’s about building relationships..you already know how to network.networking is nothing more than getting to know people. whether you realize it or not  you’re already networking every day and everywhere you go. you are networking when you strike up a conversation with the person next to you in line  introduce yourself to other parents at your child’s school  meet a friend of a friend  catch up with a former co-worker  or stop to chat with your neighbor. everyone you meet can help you move your job search forward..tapping the hidden job market may take more planning and nerve than searching online  but it’s much more effective. adopting a networking lifestyle—a lifestyle of connecting and helping others in good times and bad—will help you find the right job  make valuable connections in your chosen field  and stay focused and motivated during your job search..networking is the best way to find a job because:.people do business primarily with people they know and like. resumes and cover letters alone are often too impersonal to convince employers to hire you..job listings tend to draw piles of applicants  which puts you in intense competition with many others. networking makes you a recommended member of a much smaller pool..the job you want may not be advertised at all. networking leads to information and job leads  often before a formal job description is created or a job announced..job networking tip 1: you know more people than you think.you may think that you don’t know anyone who can help you with your job search. but you know more people than you think  and there’s a very good chance that at least a few of these people know someone who can give you career advice or point you to a job opening. you’ll never know if you don’t ask!.make a list of the people in your network.your network is bigger than you think it is. it includes all of your family members  friends  neighbors  co-workers  colleagues  and even casual acquaintances. start writing down names  and you’ll be surprised at how quickly the list grows..think about people you know from former jobs  high school and college  church  your child’s school  the gym  social media  or your neighborhood. also think about people you’ve met through your close connections: your sister’s co-worker; your best friend’s boss; your college roommate’s spouse; friends of your parents; your uncle’s business partner. don’t forget to include people like your doctor  landlord  accountant  dry cleaner  or yoga instructor..yes  you do have a job network  and it’s more powerful than you think:.you already belong to many networks (family  friends  colleagues  fellow civic club members  etc.) and your job search network can be natural outgrowth of these primary contacts..each network connects you to another network (e.g.  your child’s teacher can connect you with other parents  schools  and school suppliers)..each member of a network may know of an available job or a connection to someone who will know of one..if you’re nervous about making contact—either because you’re uncomfortable asking for favors or embarrassed about your employment situation—try to keep the following things in mind:.it feels good to help others. most people will gladly assist you if they can..people like to give advice and be recognized for their expertise..almost everyone knows what it’s like to be out of work or looking for a job. they’ll sympathize with your situation..unemployment can be isolating and stressful. by connecting with others  you’re sure to get some much needed encouragement  fellowship  and moral support..reconnecting with the people in your network should be fun—even if you have an agenda. the more this feels like a chore the more tedious and anxiety-ridden the process will be..job networking tip 2: reach out to your network.all the connections in the world won’t help you find a job if no one knows about your situation. once you’ve drawn up your list  start making contact with the people in your network. let them know that you’re looking for a job. be specific about what kind of work you’re looking for and ask them if they have any information or know anyone in a relevant field. don’t assume that certain people won’t be able to help. you may be surprised by who they know..figure out what you want before you start networking.networking is most effective when you have specific employer targets and career goals. it’s hard to get leads with a generic “let me know if you hear of anything” request. you may think that you’ll have better job luck if you leave yourself open to all the possibilities  but the reality is this “openness” creates a black hole that sucks all of the networking potential out of the connection..a generic networking request for a job is worse than no request at all  because you can lose that networking contact and opportunity. asking for specific information  leads  or an interview is much more focused and easier for the networking source. if you’re having trouble focusing your job search  you can turn to close friends and family members for help  but avoid contacting more distant people in your network until you’ve set clear goals..start with your references.when you are looking for a job  start with your references. your best references—the people who like you and can endorse your abilities  track record  and character—are major networking hubs..contact each one of your references to network about your possibilities and affirm their agreement to be your reference..describe your goals and seek their assistance..keep them informed on your job search progress..prepare them for any calls from potential employers..let them know what happened and thank them for their help regardless of the outcome..job networking tip 3: improve your communication skills.effective communication is a cornerstone of job networking. as simple as communication may seem  much of what we try to communicate—and others try to communicate to us—gets misunderstood..effective communication combines a set of learned skills: attentive listening  recognizing and using nonverbal cues  managing stress in the moment  and understanding your own emotions and those of the person you’re communicating with..attentive listening.effective listening means not just understanding the words or the information being communicated  but also understanding how the speaker feels about what they’re communicating. to listen effectively:.focus fully on the speaker and his or her body language  rather than daydreaming  texting  or doodling. if you find it hard to concentrate  try repeating the speaker’s words over in your head..avoid interrupting or trying to redirect the conversation to your concerns. listening is not the same as waiting for your turn to talk. you can’t concentrate on what someone’s saying if you’re forming what you’re going to say next..show your interest in what’s being said. nod occasionally  smile at the person  and make sure your posture is open and inviting..nonverbal communication.wordless communication  or body language  includes facial expressions  body movement and gestures  eye contact  posture  and the tone of your voice. the way you look  listen  move  and react to another person tells them more about how you’re feeling than words alone ever can..you can enhance effective communication by using open body language—arms uncrossed  standing with an open stance or sitting on the edge of your seat  and maintaining eye contact with the person you’re talking to..body language can emphasize or enhance your verbal message—patting a friend on the back while complimenting him on his success  for example  or pounding your fists to underline your message..managing stress.overwhelming stress can hamper effective communication by disrupting your capacity to think clearly and creatively  and act appropriately. when you’re stressed  you’re more likely to misread other people and send confusing or off-putting nonverbal signals..to quickly deal with stress while communicating:.recognize when you’re becoming stressed. are your muscles tight? are your hands clenched? is your breath shallow?.take a moment to calm down. take a few deep breaths  clench and relax your muscles  or take a break if possible. stroll outside or spend a few minutes in a quiet place to regain your balance..bring your senses to the rescue. the best way to rapidly and reliably relieve stress is through your senses: sight  sound  touch  taste  and smell. wearing a favorite perfume or cologne  or keeping a photo of your family at hand may help to calm you..find the humor. when used appropriately  humor is a great way to diffuse stress. lighten the mood by sharing a joke or amusing story..emotional awareness.developing emotional awareness provides you the tools for understanding both yourself and other people  and the real messages they are communicating to you. although knowing your own feelings may seem simple  many people ignore or try to sedate strong emotions like anger  sadness  and fear. but your ability to communicate effectively depends on being connected to these feelings. if you’re afraid of strong emotions or insist on communicating only on a rational level  it will impair your ability to fully understand others and build strong connections..job networking tip 4: focus on building relationships.networking is a give-and-take process that involves making connections  sharing information  and asking questions. it’s a way of relating to others  not a technique for getting a job or a favor. you don’t have to hand out your business cards on street corners  cold call everyone on your contact list  or work a room of strangers. all you have to do is reach out..be authentic. in any job search or networking situation  being you—the real you—should be your goal. hiding who you are or suppressing your true interests and goals will only hurt you in the long run. pursuing what you want and not what you think others will like  will always be more fulfilling and ultimately more successful..be considerate. if you’re reconnecting with an old friend or colleague  take the time to get through the catching-up phase before you blurt out your need. on the other hand  if this person is a busy professional you don’t know well  be respectful of his or her time and come straight out with your request..ask for advice  not a job. don’t ask for a job  a request comes with a lot of pressure. you want your contacts to become allies in your job search  not make them feel ambushed  so ask for information or insight instead. if they’re able to hire you or refer you to someone who can  they will. if not  you haven’t put them in the uncomfortable position of turning you down or telling you they can’t help..be specific in your request. before you go off and reconnect with everyone you’ve ever known  get your act together and do a little homework. be prepared to articulate what you’re looking for. is it a reference? an insider’s take on the industry? a referral? an introduction to someone in the field? also make sure to provide an update on your qualifications and recent professional experience..slow down and enjoy the job networking process.the best racecar drivers are masters of slowing down. they know that the fastest way around the track is by slowing down going into the turns  so they can accelerate sooner as they’re heading into the straightaway. as you’re networking  keep this “slow in  fast out” racing mantra in mind..effective networking is not something that should be rushed. this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try to be efficient and focused  but hurried  emergency networking is not conducive to building relationships for mutual support and benefit. when you network  you should slow down  be present  and try to enjoy the process. this will speed up your chances for success in the job-hunting race. just because you have an agenda doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy reconnecting..don’t be a hit-and-run networker.don’t be a hit-and-run networker: connecting  getting what you want  and then disappearing  never to be heard from until the next time you need something. invest in your network by following up and providing feedback to those who were kind of enough to offer their help. thank them for their referral and assistance. let them know whether you got the interview or the job. or use the opportunity to report on the lack of success or the need for additional help..job networking tip 5: evaluate the quality of your network.if your networking efforts don’t seem to be going anywhere  you may need to evaluate the quality of your network. take some time to think about your network’s strengths  weaknesses  and opportunities. without such an evaluation  there is little chance your network will adapt to your needs and your future goals. you may not notice how bound you are to history  or how certain connections are holding you back. and you may miss opportunities to branch out and forge new ties that will help you move forward..taking inventory of your network and where it is lacking is time well spent. if you feel your network is out of date  then it’s time to upgrade! your mere awareness of your needs will help you connect you with new and more relevant contacts and networks..rate your network.give yourself 1 point for each question you answer yes..do you trust your network to give you the truth about the real you?.does your network challenge you as much as it supports you?.does your network feel vibrant and dynamic?.does your network represent your future goals as much as your past?.are the networks connected to your network strong?.5 pts – your network is in great shape!.3-4 pts – you need to enhance your network..0-2 pts – your network needs a makeover..job networking tip 6: take advantage of both “strong” and “weak” ties.everyone has both “strong” and “weak” ties. strong ties occupy that inner circle and weak ties are less established. adding people to networks is time consuming  especially strong ties. it requires an investment of time and energy to have multiple “best friends.” trying to stay in touch with new acquaintances is just as challenging..but adding new “weak tie” members gives your network vitality and even more cognitive flexibility—the ability to consider new ideas and options. new relationships invigorate the network by providing a connection to new networks  viewpoints  and opportunities..tips for strengthening your job network.tap into your strong ties. your strong ties will logically and trustingly lead to new weak ties that build a stronger network. use your existing network to add members and reconnect with people. start by engaging the people in your trusted inner circle to help you fill in the gaps in your network..think about where you want to go. your network should reflect where you’re going  not just where you’ve been. adding people to your network who reflect issues  jobs  industries  and areas of interest is essential. if you are a new graduate or a career changer  join the professional associations that represent your desired career path. attending conferences  reading journals  and keeping up with the lingo of your desired field can prepare you for where you want to go..make the process of connecting a priority. make connecting a habit—part of your lifestyle. connecting is just as important as your exercise routine. it breathes life into you and gives you confidence. find out how your network is doing in this environment  what steps they are taking  and how you can help. as you connect  the world will feel smaller and a small world is much easier to manage..job networking tip 7: take the time to maintain your network.maintaining your job network is just as important as building it. accumulating new contacts can be beneficial  but only if you have the time to nurture the relationships. avoid the irrational impulse to meet as many new people as possible. the key is quality  rather than quantity. focus on cultivating and maintaining your existing network. you’re sure to discover an incredible array of information  knowledge  expertise  and opportunities..schedule time with your key contacts.list the people who are crucial to your network—people you know who can and have been very important to you. invariably  there will be some you have lost touch with. reconnect and then schedule a regular meeting or phone call. you don’t need a reason to get in touch. it will always make you feel good and provide you with an insight or two..prioritize the rest of your contacts.keep a running list of people you need to reconnect with. people whose view of the world you value. people you’d like to get to know better or whose company you enjoy. prioritize these contacts and then schedule time into your regular routine so you can make your way down the list..take notes on the people in your network.collecting cards and filing them is a start. but maintaining your contacts  new and old  requires updates. add notes about their families  their jobs  their interests  and their needs. unless you have a photographic memory  you won’t remember all of this information unless you write it down. put these updates and notes on the back of their business cards or input them into your contact database..find ways to reciprocate.always remember that successful networking is a two-way street. your ultimate goal is to cultivate mutually beneficial relationships. that means giving as well as receiving. send a thank-you note  ask them about their family  email an article you think they might be interested in  and check in periodically to see how they’re doing. by nurturing the relationship through your job search and beyond  you’ll establish a strong network of people you can count on for ideas  advice  feedback  and support..helpguide thanks john e. kobara

day at home on the computer  trolling job sites  submitting their resumes  and then waiting to get a call requesting an interview. and waiting. and waiting..the job you want is very unlikely to land in your lap this way. instead  the job will go to the man hitting the pavement and talking to real humans face to face. read on: click here for original source of this article.looking for a job? take the initiative!.this month  nearly 2 million students left colleges and universities around the country with a bachelor’s degree in hand. some will be headed to graduate school  while others will be entering the job market  many hoping to land their first “real” job. at the same time  3 million high school graduates have started looking for a summer gig–perhaps their first job ever. joining them in the job hunt are the millions of americans who have been laid off  are unemployed  and have been looking to get hired for weeks  months  even years..what all these folks have in common is that they’re searching for a job in a tough economy. while experts debate whether things are looking up or whether we’re headed for even worse times  the reality for job seekers out there is that competition is tight. the plumb jobs will go to the bright  to those who are well-connected and know how to network  and  most of all…to those who know how to hustle..too many men see the job search as a passive process. they spend each day at home on the computer  trolling monster.com and other job sites  submitting their resumes  and then waiting to get a call requesting an interview. and waiting. and waiting..the job you want is very unlikely to land in your lap this way. instead  the job will go to the man hitting the pavement–the man who takes the initiative. here are some tips on how to grab the bull by the horns when you’re looking for a job..note: obviously  one of the best ways to take the initiative in finding work is to start your own biz. but the focus of this article will be landing a job with someone else..hand in your resume in person.the surest way to remain unemployed is to be like the guy mentioned above—submitting your resumes online and then sitting on your hands waiting for a call. hr departments are like employment bermuda triangles—your resume gets sent to who knows where to be read by who knows who  if at all. and even if your resume does get read  what will differentiate it from the hundreds of others in the stack?.instead  if it’s possible  print out your resume/cover letter/application  and go in person to hand it to whomever is responsible for hiring (the hiring manager  your potential supervisor  the head of the department  etc.) for the job you want. figuring out who is responsible for hiring can be difficult at large  faceless corporations  but often can be done by looking online and making some calls..this is how i have gotten most of the jobs i’ve had in my life. in each instance  the person was pleased with my initiative  interviewed me right on the spot  and  in some cases  offered me the job right then and there..obviously  handing in your resume in person works better for lower-level jobs than more professional ones  but it can be effective in a variety of situations. awhile back  aom community member ben d. posted an awesome little article on the community blog about how he landed a job as a respiratory therapist by using this method:.“when my wife and i moved to chicago  we had no connections here. no jobs  no family  and minimal money. the assumption was that i would be able to find a job in short order. before we moved  i updated my resume  applied online to many jobs  and then sat back and waited..when the move was over and we had settled in  i still did not have a job. i had a couple of leads  but they were at companies that are considered resume stains in my profession. still  a crappy job beats no job  so i bit the bullet  called the hiring manager  and got hired at the resume stain..after one shift i had had enough. while the people were nice  the job and the company were crap. i began formulating plans for my escape. i applied to more jobs online and then waited. that is how one applies for a job  right?.wrong. i was listening to public radio and a story came on about how people seeking work would fill out online applications  post their resume to monster  and then just wait for a job to fall into their laps. listening to this it struck me how absurd and un-manly that was. unless you can poop golden eggs  you are just one faceless resume in a sea of thousands. i decided to get my job the manly way: with hard work  initiative  and elbow grease..i printed my resume  wrote a custom cover letter for the company i was applying to  and signed it in pen. i folded these items up into an envelope and addressed it to the hiring manager  put on my good suit and tie  and drove down to the company..it struck me that what i was about to do–to cold-call a hiring manager–was risky. he could be in a bad mood or out of the office. any number of bad things could happen. but i wanted this job  and i had nothing to lose..i choked down my nerves  straightened my tie  put on a big confident smile  and strode through the doors. a little sniffing around brought me to the manager’s office. i knocked on the door  introduced myself with a big smile and a handshake  and before he knew it he had my resume and cover letter in his hands. i explained myself. “just didn’t want to be another face in the crowd  thought i’d take a little initiative and stop by in person.” he sat me down for an interview  and an hour later i left with a promise from him that he’d be in touch..a few days later i got a phone call and a job offer. soon  i will be employed at a company that i respect and that has a great reputation. i got the job i actually wanted  not just one i was randomly hired for from the internet. i got a good job at a good company  and i got to make that critical first impression a good one  all by eschewing the trappings of the internet job hunt for the old-fashioned manly way of getting a job. another victory for manliness!”.another victory for manliness  indeed  ben. and to the victor go the spoils..follow up!.whether you submit your resume online or hand it over in person  your job is not yet done. now you must follow up! hiring managers have a lot on their plate  as do department heads and supervisors for whom hiring is just one small part of what they do. so show your sincere interest in the job by following up with an email or phone call..if a job posting gave a deadline for the application window  then follow up a couple of days after the deadline passes–following up before then will make you seem impatient. when you follow up  say something like  “because the deadline for x job closed on june 11  i assume that applications have begun to be reviewed. i just wanted to express my sincere interest in the position. my [couple of key qualities] would make me a great fit for the job.” if you can find out something about the company’s culture or the kind of people the hiring manager likes to hire  then mention your connection to those things..if the job posting didn’t have a deadline  then wait a week to ten days after you submit your application to follow up. then give the hiring manager a call  and say something like  “my name is bob smith and i submitted my resume on june 11 for x job  and i was wondering if the position had been filled yet. no? well  [express interest in job + a couple of things that make you well qualified for it]..if you’ve done an interview with the company  but haven’t heard back from them within the time frame they gave you (and make sure to ask for a timeline at the end of the interview if they don’t tell you)  then the day after the original time frame expires  follow up with a phone call or email reaffirming your interest in the job  saying politely that you realize the hiring process can take awhile  and inquiring if they could give you an updated timeline on when they will be making a decision..if the company didn’t give you a timeline to begin with  then wait a week and a half after your interview before following up..whether you’re following up on a submitted application or on an interview  keep it to two attempts. if you don’t get an answer on the first follow-up  send an email a week later. still no answer? move on..“apply” for unadvertised jobs and jobs that don’t yet exist.many of the very best jobs out there will never show up in the classifieds. the company doesn’t advertise the positions publicly and instead hires friends  internal employees  or folks they have worked with or heard about in other capacities. so you’ll never get these gigs by waiting around for a job posting to show up. instead  you have to take the initiative!.if there’s some place you want to work  and some position you’re hoping to get  send an email with your resume to the person you think would be in charge of hiring for that position. tell them that if the job opens up  you’d love to be considered and why you’re qualified for the position..you should put yourself out there even if a position or job you want doesn’t yet exist  or if you’re a freelancer hoping to pick up a new client who doesn’t even know he needs your services yet. get a feel for what the company does currently  and where they could use help or could potentially expand  and then contact them and offer your services  giving them a specific idea of something you could do for them. tell them you’re a big fan of what they do (hopefully this is actually true) and that you would be willing to do a project for them free of charge or at a discount to give back; doing something new is a risky proposition for the potential client  so they’ll be much more willing to give you a go if it won’t cost them much. now they might not be able to use you at that moment  but down the road a need for your services may arise  and when it does  they’ll think of you first..let me give you some examples from running the art of manliness. back in 2009  ted slampyak contacted me saying how much he liked aom  and volunteering to take part in our swymj series. three years passed (three years!)  but this year  the site was finally generating enough revenue to do something i had wanted to do since starting aom: hire an illustrator to do illustrations for some of our posts. when we were thinking about how to find someone who could do illustrations with an aom feel  kate said  “hey  how about that guy who did the sywmj interview? he does really cool stuff.” and so now ted is our go-to guy for all our illustration needs..second case in point:.when i originally started aom in january 2008  i did all the design work myself. for a law student with no web or graphic design experience  i did okay  but i knew the site could look a whole lot better if a professional applied their talents to it. enter eric granata. eric has been reading aom since the beginning and was an active participant in our first version of the aom forums. in early 2008  eric reached out in an email introducing himself as a fellow okie  aom fan  and web designer. he volunteered his services for any graphic and web design needs that we might have. i had a small project that i needed done  and eric did it completely gratis as a way to say thanks for the content on aom..we were so impressed with eric’s work  we kept going back to him for other projects  but this time as a paying customer. in 2009  we hired eric to do a complete redesign of aom. the site you’re looking at today is eric’s handiwork. we’ve become a regular paying client of eric’s  and it all started with him taking the initiative and volunteering his services..i could go on with more examples  but i think you get the idea. start offering your services to people  and planting as many seeds as you can. they may not sprout immediately  but could very well bear fruit down the road..and  it should go without saying  but even if you do that first thing for a potential client for free or at a discount  knock it out of the park! it’s basically your interview for a job. wow the client with what you can do  and he’ll wonder what he ever did without you and eagerly start throwing more fully paid work your way. half-ass it and your window of opportunity will close..take the initiative!.so why do these initiative-taking methods work so well? well  believe or not  companies have just as hard a time finding good people  as good people do finding good jobs. put yourself in the shoes of the person doing the hiring—they’ve got stacks of applications to look through and it’s hard to distinguish on paper who might be worth calling in for an interview. it takes a lot of work to make that decision. by showing some initiative  you help do some of the work for them  as it shows you have moxie and ambition and that you really want this job: qualities that represent a big percentage of what they’re looking for in an employee..now taking the initiative in your job search doesn’t mean you’ll land your dream job tomorrow. but it is guaranteed to get you hired faster than waiting around for your next job to land in your lap..posted on september 18  2014 september 18  2014.lds ward employment specialist: checklist for helping job

voice.written by.meljr	.posted in.eazy job search	.this is how i feel about job hunting. meljr.see original article by: kevin donlin   star tribune sales and marketing.maybe you’ve heard the “golden voice” of youtube sensation  ted williams. he’s the formerly homeless  formerly unemployed man who was hired — literally off the street — by the cleveland cavaliers for his dream job as an announcer. other job offers are still pouring in from around the country. if you’re unemployed  you can learn a lot from ted williams’ guerrilla job search..here’s why ….no social worker on earth would say to a homeless person  “you know what you need to do? go stand in traffic with a sign and talk like a radio dj to every person you meet.” ted could have followed conventional advice — gone to his local workforce center or library  waited to use the free computers  and applied online for advertised jobs. and he would still be unemployed..luckily  ted williams is a natural born guerrilla job hunter. he did four simple things  which you can do  too ….1) ted got out of the house and met people.if there’s one advantage to being homeless in a job search  it’s this: you can’t avoid meeting people. by contrast  unemployed people with homes often go to great lengths to avoid people. they sit at home  in front of the computer  zapping out resumes by email and feeling productive. but that’s usually a pointless waste of time..instead  ted was out in the game  every day  meeting and telling people about the job he wanted. and he met just the right person — a reporter who told his story. the rest is history. you never know who you will meet on the street. that person ahead of you in line at 7-eleven  or sitting next to you at starbucks  may be a vp at your dream employer. of course the chances of meeting your dream employer on the street this week are small. but your chances are zero if you stay at home and never get out..burning questions:.* do you know exactly what job you want to do? there are plenty of homeless (and “homed”) people looking for “any job” … and they struggle for months..* how many people have you talked to this week about your job? how do you know? what is your quota?.2) ted didn’t use an ordinary resume.you can’t get much less ordinary than ted’s “resume” — it was handwritten  in magic marker … on a piece of cardboard. the first line read  “i have a god given gift of voice.” that’s … extraordinary. not recommended for most people  who should print their resume on paper and hand-deliver it to hiring managers  if possible. but a great idea starter. more importantly  ted didn’t waste weeks revising his resume until it was “perfect.”.burning questions:.* how many ordinary resumes have you sent to employers?.* if you’re not yet ready  how much longer will you wait for your resume to be “perfect” before sending it out? and how many jobs have you missed out on in the meantime?.3) ted didn’t interview  he performed.when most job seekers get an interview  they retell success stories from their past  hoping employers will take a leap of faith and hire them. bleh. ted performed for anyone who would listen. his first “interview” — the youtube video that made him famous overnight — didn’t feature him begging for a job. no  he was doing the job in that video interview. big difference..burning questions:.* how can you perform your most-employable skills at a moment’s notice?.* if you’re in sales  you can pick up a phone book and make cold calls..* if you’re a designer  you can draw on napkin..* a teacher can deliver a memorable 5-minute lesson..* a customer service manager can pose as a customer  call his target employer  and analyze their phone service..you get the idea — there is no job that cannot be performed in an interview. because  if you’re hired you will have to perform anyway. why wait?.4) ted kept a positive outlook.yes  your situation may be dire. you may have been jobless for months or years. you may have troubles with your finances  family  or health. but you probably won’t be sleeping under a highway overpass tonight. so do what it takes to greet the world with a smile. it’s the fastest way to make the best impression on anyone. and it doesn’t cost a dime..if ted  a homeless  recovering alcoholic/addict  can be unfailingly polite and positive in his dealings with others  so can you. just watch his video on youtube  if you haven’t already. still not able to stay positive? fine — fake it for just 30 minutes tomorrow. get out of the house. meet one person. talk to them about your job. perform your skill. do it with a smile..after that  you can go home and scowl for the rest of the day. at least you’ll have a home to go to..bottom line: if you get out  meet people  send an extraordinary resume  and “perform” in a positive way — like ted williams — you may find a job  too. or the job may find you..that’s the guerrilla way..kevin donlin is contributing co-author of “guerrilla marketing for job hunters 2.0.”

the more we complain about being too politically correct the more politically correct we get and this shit has got to stop. everything offends someone in this day and age  it never fails. you can’t say cunt without women coming down on you  you can’t make any racial notification (not slur) without offending some race’s not really appointed group of mouthpieces and you can’t dare make a joke which is even the least bit harsh without being publicly shamed for having a sense of humor that is outside of the mainstream (or what passes for the mainstream). i make “off color” jokes all the time and i you know what? they get laughs followed by looks of shame from those who laughed at them. it’s a kind of cultural guilt that you find something funny that you think society will punish you for finding funny..why do we have to be politically correct anyway? are we not a nation that  in theory at least  is based on the principle of freedom of speech and the free flow of ideas? how does limiting the ideas (even ones that are offensive) serve the goal of true freedom? how does cutting off or penalizing the speech that you don’t like further the ideal of freedom of speech? now  before this gets thrown back at me let me state that yes  there are indeed limits to the freedom that speech is afforded in the us and there should be (reasonably so)  you can’t call for the murder of someone else and have that protected the same as you can’t incite a riot or things of that nature. those things are crimes because they are advocating criminal acts with serious criminal ramifications… on the other hand one could argue that publicly calling for the legalization of weed (still a crime to grow/use/sell in most states) should fall under the same parameters as the old chestnut of yelling fire in a crowded theater  i disagree as one is harmful to the people themselves and one is not  that is a huge dividing line. so what are the limits of free speech that political correctness has thrust upon us in an ever increasing and oppressive move to homogenize the population? obviously racial slurs of any kind are now verboten in good and “normal” society* but we have also added sexual slurs and… well slurs of any kind really. in this new politically correct world you can’t dislike another person (or group) for any reason  that is not politically correct don’t ya know. well  that is not true actually  slurs are okay when they are used by the people traditionally thought of as the victims (more often than not today  a self ascribed victim). you can’t call a homosexual a fag  but they can call you a breeder. sounds a little one sided there. you can’t use any slur against a non white race but in turn it’s fine for them to call you whitebread  ofay  blue eyed devil  cracker  gringo  honky  peckerwood  roundeye or wigger. those are all socially accepted due to this somewhat skewed perception that whites should not have freedom to speak as they wish  but all other races should.** why is this? why does political correctness only seem to attach itself in some cases and not in others? what the hell am i saying  i don’t want it in any case but i wanted to point out the duality that we give political correctness. political correctness is something that only has as much power as we allow it to have so in essence this is all of your fault  all of it. you allowed it to get this far and now it is growing exponentially..now  there are groups out there who’s sole existence is to find something to be offended about at all times. any racial group such as the naacp troll the news and internet looking for something to get offended about  thereby justifying their own existence. they don’t get offended when someone that they represent does something politically incorrect  only when something politically incorrect is done to them do they act. i am not singling out the naacap for any real reason other then they are the first that sprang to mind  with them being one of the most visible and vocal of the “offended” groups. every race  every sexual orientation  every religion  every group and sub-group has one of these. you people need to stop being offended at everything and learn just what freedom of speech and freedom in general actually means..they have made the media politically correct to such a degree that they are including disclaimers on re-releases of old movies and even cartoons. the warner brother looney tunes golden collection includes some of those  no doubt about it  racist cartoons from the 30’s and 40’s… with a disclaimer on them that warner brothers does not endorse racism blah  blah  blah. to their credit though they also include an introduction by whoopi goldberg that puts these cartoons in their historical context and explains why they are being included in this set and while that is admirable it was really still just a marketing move as warner brothers knew leaving those particular cartoons out would have brought them up anyway. anyone remember the 1985 breakout adult feature new wave hookers? you don’t? prudes. new wave hookers was an early dark brothers movie about 2 scummy guys in an office dreaming about becoming pimps and… well it’s a porn  you know where this went. anyway  the movie is a hardcore film and yet the dvd is censored… not for the reason(s) you think it is. most people know that new wave hookers originally had a scene with traci “i will sell all of you out to get famous” lords in it  which after the reveal about her age lies was cut to remove her from the film. well that version is not on dvd obviously  but no  the dvd has bleeps in it. the sex is all uncut still but the dvd bleeps out racial slurs from the two guys (one white  one black). nigger and chink are bleeped. how the fuck do you countenance that? oh  ginger lynn getting dped is okay (and hot) but a punk that says nigger is not? i have never seen this kind of censorship before this modern era. my laserdisc of new wave hookers has the language intact… but the dvd does not. you see this kind of thing on tv all the time  i saw fox movie channel attempt to air american history x last year and they silenced out every racial slur in the movie. what is the point then? this is a movie about how racism will destroy you and you go and nerf it all up? i think fox missed the point. were you afraid that people might burn down burbank if you allowed ed norton to say nigger on tv?.hell  look at the cocksuckers that try to kill people over jokes!!! muslims are a group that really can’t take a joke or even a reference made to them. riots  riots  were started over a danish cartoon that depicted mohammad. muslims rioted and attempted to kill the cartoonist for daring to depict their precious made up man. they did this again a few years ago to parker and stone of south park for simply implying mohammad was involved and comedy central of course caved the hell in and gave these 15th century throwbacks*** what they wanted. the christians are not a hell of alot better  the also hold their fictional man up to such heights that they get tv shows taken off the air for “blasphemy” or daring to teach people reason over blind faith in nothing. when it comes to humor there will never be consensus but that alone should not disqualify something from being laughed at. we all laugh at things that should not be funny or are so politically incorrect that we can’t help but laugh at them. hell  the last time i was on the phone to my editor at hustler i pitched him 2 cartoons that were in such bad taste that he said they absolutely are contenders for print and perhaps for “most tasteless cartoon” awards… be he laughed at them too so….when did being politically correct (on this level) really begin? words and descriptions that used to be common place (no matter how misguided) have now become punishable conduct  so how did we get here? i was born in 1975 and i can’t remember the exact year i first heard the term “politically correct” it was in the mid to late 80’s though as i was starting high school but the term did not find usage in the mainstream until the 1990’s. the first instances i encountered of political correctness were them dulling our language in a concentrated effort to placate the populace. if you keep people focused on irrelevant things like words then they don’t notice when you slip bills past them which give corporations complete freedom or allow the teaching of religious doctrine in public schools. they use political correctness as a magician uses misdirection and slight of hand… look over here and pay no attention to what is going on over there. anyway  i was in high school from 1989 to 1993 and in that short time i saw quite a but of political correct bullshit pass before me. i saw the dulling of language as stated above but i also saw the slow retreat of thought as well. when they tell you how you can talk and what words you can use they are training your brain to their way of thinking (as it were). you were being indoctrinated into a way of thinking without even realizing it. godwin’s law here but damn it this really is how the nazi’s controlled their population  they decided what words you could use and in doing so they dehumanized an entire race of people all the while keeping the patriotism of their citizens. to extreme of an example? well it is also apt. you can not allow political correctness to erode your mind or your sensibilities. you need to stand up and force the us to stop being so sensitive about things and learn to sit side by side with something they may not agree with. those in power (coupled with those who wanted power) took advantage of you and your ignorance. they played you and worse yet you not only let them but you thanked them for it. you are the problem here  if you would grow a backbone then they could not control you but you would rather be fat and happy and not have to think..*which i consider part and parcel of having freedom. you get to hate what you hate  no matter the ignorance involved in that hate. slurs are protected and should remain that way.**let me note here i am simply calling out the hypocrisy of this whole thing  i do not approve of whites being racist twats anymore than i do any other group being racist assholes..***i call these people throwbacks  not all muslims  just those that refuse to grow and move past their narrow  narrow  views of the world and women..tell me to shut the fuck up a 1201beyond@gmail.com or contact alex to fire me at alexjowski@gmail.com.josh hadleypcsanity is razor thin.share on:.tweet.03-30-13 – episode 92.episode #002 – beauti-fools fest 03 – 10 year retrospective pt.1.about the author.josh hadley.i am a harsh film critic with no sense of subtlety or tact. i tend to love non-mainstream films  not out of a sense of ‘rebellion’ or non-conformity but out of the sense that most of what is popular is shit and that by definition the mainstream will be mainstream and therefore useless. i am easily approachable and i love to hear feedback from people  both positive (lies) and negative (truth) so please  call me out on the stupid shit i say and do..related posts.episode #007.10-11-14 – episode 172.connect.sponsor.@beyond1201.tweets by beyond1201.sponsor.contact.advertising.shop.site issues / general.site info.terms & conditions.site news.

should you attend this graduate school? should you take this job offer or that one? allah knows what is best for you  and if you are not sure about a choice that you have  seek his guidance..1. perform 2 rakaah nafl.2. face qibla  make this dua.istikhara3.oh allah! i seek your guidance by virtue of your knowledge  and i seek ability by virtue of your power  and i ask you of your great bounty. you have power; i have none. and you know; i know not. you are the knower of hidden things.oh allah! if in your knowledge  (this matter*) is good for my religion  my livelihood and my affairs  immediate and in the future  then ordain it for me  make it easy for me  and bless it for me. and if in your knowledge  (this matter*) is bad for my religion  my livelihood and my affairs  immediate and in the future  then turn it away from me  and turn me away from it. and ordain for me the good wherever it may be  and make me content with it..transliteration:.allahumma inni astakheeroka bi ilmik. wa’astaq-diroka biqodratik. wa’as’aloka min fadlikal-azeem. fa’innaka taqdiru wala aqdir. wata lamo wala-a lam. wa’anta-allamul ghuyoob.allahumma in kunta ta lamu anna (hathal-amra*) khayul-lee fi deenee wama ashi wa ajila amri wa’ajilah  faqdorho lee  wayassirho lee  thomma-barik lee fih. wa’in konta ta lamo anna (hathal-amra*) sharrul-lee fi deenee. wama ashi. wa ajila amri. wa’ajilaho. fasrifho annee. wasrifnee anh. waqdur leyal-khayr haytho kan. thomma ardini bih..* when making the du’a  the actual matter or decision should be mentioned instead of the words “hathal-amra” (“this matter”)..3. sometimes it takes only once to get the answer and sometimes it takes longer. it is better to do istakhara seven (7) times. if you have received an answer stop doing istikhara. you do not have to continue to do isitkhara for 7 days..4. you don’t have to have a dream  it could be a strong feeling that inclines you to a certain decision..about the author.more from this author ».facebook comments:.post a reply cancel reply.your email address will not be published. required fields are marked *.comment.name *.email *.website.save my name  email  and website in this browser for the next time i comment..notify me of follow-up comments by email..notify me of new posts by email..« good deed #476 – see prospective marriage partner	.good deed #478 – consent for marriage ».seeking serenity.my arabic alphabet.categories.articles.challenge.good deeds.pending.uncategorized.download free android tasbeeh.archives.archives select month may 2020 december 2016 june 2016 november 2015 july 2015 june 2015 july 2013 june 2013 january 2013 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 january 2012 november 2011 october 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009.home.about.good deeds.challenge.share.contact.my arabic alphabet.archive.© 2020 1000 good deeds. theme by solostream..top.twitter facebook rss.grab this.

blue eyed devil,"15 minute lunch: get it togetha  baby..2/18/08.get it togetha  baby..don't get me wrong  i do think wanda sykes can be funny. but those applebees commercials drive me bat-shit insane. i can't even imagine the truckloads of cash they must have offered her to get her to become the official voice of the black apple. i know that sounds like the name of a new superhero  but trust me  it's not. it's just a talking apple. with no face. with no... anything really. oh  a hat. i think it has a hat now..but all winter-wear aside  it's just an apple. that's it..the sheer un-brilliance of this idea just boggles my mind. i can't believe someone from a supposedly high-ticket ad agency pitched it  and i can't believe someone at applebees signed off on it..i know you could use the argument ""hey  if you had a talking apple  you wouldn't be saying ""oh  it's just a talking apple  no big deal"" and you'd be right. if i actually had a talking apple in my posession  it wouldn't take me long to parlay that into becoming rich beyond my wildest dreams. unless of course it sounded like wanda. then i would just be moderately well-to-do  because talking apple or not  nobody can actually listen to her voice for any length of time without being driven to a homicidal rage. it sounds like a power saw cutting sheet metal. the same holds true for rosie perez and fran drescher  now that i think about it..it really doesn't do much either. i guess that's fair  since it has no appendages to speak of. it just sort of....bounces around slightly in one place while it tells you what to do..also  i'm not sure what sort of apple-y orifice it actually uses to speak  but i think it's safe to assume that it's not being done telepathically  because i don't think wanda wouldn't go for that. i am pretty sure that no matter how big the payoff  she would draw the line at mind-voicing telepathic restaurant-chain apples. that's all speculation on my part  of course. i could be wrong..i'd still like to see the version of the commercial where the guy being berated by the black apple finally has enough  and he scoops it up and takes a giant bite out of it right at the table. then  while his wife and children look on in horror  he continues to eat it until the screaming stops..i guess it's pretty obvious why my career in advertising didn't work out..bonus question of the day: i've recently been approached by a company that wants to pay me a small amount of money to run a series of short  humorous videos on my blog. i've only seen the first one  and it wasn't horrible. they assure me that the rest are funnier. there's nine of them in total  and if i agree  they'd be run twice a week for a month. i am currently weighing what's left of my blogger integrity against the offer of cold hard cash  and unbelievably  i'm still undecided. one day i lean toward becoming a professional whore -- mostly because my roof is leaking -- but on other days i think that i don't particularly enjoy videos on blogs. there is also the possibility that the videos may actually turn out to be funny. let me know your two cents..feed: humor-blogs.com.by johnny virgil at 1:55 pm.reactions:.email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest.110 comments:.kentucky_kitty 2:25 pm.wanda sykes grates on my last raw exposed bleeding nerve. hate her..go for the videos johnny! if you don't try  you'll never know. right?.replydelete.replies.reply.bystander 2:32 pm.take the money and fix the roof. we don't have to watch the videos if we don't want to..replydelete.replies.reply.daniel shackelford 2:44 pm.go ahead  take the money. don't let my absence stop you..replydelete.replies.reply.anonymous 2:53 pm.i thought i was alone at staring dumbfounded at the television the first time i saw that ad. the creative process is always hit or miss  but c'mon. i've seen our family dog show more creativity in how he squats to crap in the snow; and i'd frankly  rather watch that for 30 seconds  even in inclement weather.....and take the money. a roof hole is very unfunny business..replydelete.replies.reply.dewdropdream 3:17 pm.i was wondering why you didn't post a video of the ad and the end of your post answered that. i'm going to have to google for it now coz am curious about its irritation potential..on a different note  your blog happens to be really popular and an offer of money for a few video posts is probably what some bloggers would think of as a windfall... well  fame and fortune in blogland seem to come rare so i personally think you ought to go for it. unless of course  you write this blog with a different purpose in mind and the whole video posting thing seems to deviate a radan from that purpose. good luck either way :).replydelete.replies.reply.semky 3:17 pm.jv ... do you get the right to edit or do all nine have to run?

white power ranger,"stranger 71  day 71 - meet alex  the ""apparel designer"" | 100 strangers  100 days.inspiring connections one stranger a day.stories.about.contact.stranger stories.stranger 71  day 71 – meet alex  the “apparel designer”	.i met alex at a retailer in the mall this morning. i really don’t like going to malls especially so close to the holidays. however  i wanted to check something out  so i went to the mall before it opened. when the store i was interested in finally opened  it was slow enough to ask the associate i was working with if he’d be my stranger today  to which he was happy to do so..and mind you  i told him i wasn’t going to buy anything today. in fact  i had already scoped out the product for a while before saying i would wait. (just in case you were wondering he accepted just to complete a sale.) 🙂.meet alex  26.who are you?.“young  professional trying to figure out what i want to do with my life. definitely still figuring it out. day at a time. not really knowing what’s going on. not planning. just jumping in  waking up  and just doing it.”.what are your passions?.“apparel design. outside of here  i  actually  have my own apparel design company that i’ve been working on launching for the last thee years.”.when are you going to do that?.“hoping by the end of 2017.”.why did you want to get into apparel design?.“my mom. i’ve always admired her  and she used to sew when i was a kid. i picked it up off of her.”.what did she sew for you?.“for me  halloween costumes ” he laughs. “she did all of my costumes.”.what was your favorite?.“she made me a white power ranger costume because we couldn’t find my size.”.how else has she inspired you?.“being the strong individual that she is. she’s very strong. always motivated. never negative. smile on her face 24/7 even if she’s having a bad day. definitely someone i aspire to be when i’m older  for sure.”.when you think about designing clothes and building that brand  are there any values or anything she’s done to inspire you that you want to make sure you carry over into that brand?.“just passion and motivation. make sure every piece shows there’s passion behind it and not have it as a second thing.”.what kind of fashion do you want to design?.“women’s evening wear. i actually went to school for that.” he tells me how he went to savannah college of art and design (scad)..meanwhile  i notice he has an ohio state university bow tie on  and ask if he’s going to be supporting them for the game today (pretty much a given  but was curious where/ what he might add on to this)..“i am  and unfortunately  i’m stuck here!” he laughs. “the biggest game of the year  and i’m stuck here!” we’re referring to the osu-michigan game today in a top-5 clash..why the ohio state?.“my dad went there. his whole family went there. i started my undergrad there  and then transferred to scad to finish it.”.anything else that you’re really  really passionate about?.“football!”.why is football such an influential sport and part of our culture?.“culturally  i’m not 100% sure. i know i do it because it’s the one thing that bonds my father and me. yeah  football’s the one thing that bonds us together; whereas  my mom and i have always had a strong bond my entire life. my dad and i only bond on saturdays during football season.” alex laughs again..thinking about that bonding… what was your earliest bonding experience with your dad?.“when i was 10  he actually took me up to the ohio state campus to watch the michigan. we were at the 50-yard line.” so today was a real big day for alex given today’s ohio state game against michigan..“it’s a big day more so personally than it is actually for the game just because it is the best memory i had with my dad.”.alex’s dad will be able to watch  and alex will be at the store listening. i asked him if they were going to be texting throughout to which alex responded  “of course. of course. as long as my other managers don’t talk to me  i’ll be good.” he laughs..going back to your passion of apparel design where do you see that going? where do you want that to go?.“i mean  i’ll always aim big. hopefully be a huge design like dior and mcqueen and all that. on a smaller scale  i  more so  want to work with different philanthropy programs  and work on maybe donating to different charities and use my name for positive instead of just fame.”.why do you want to do that?.“it’s just always been something my mom’s instilled in me. always make sure people know you came from humble beginnings. don’t forget where you came from.”.i realize  too  that alex is working in a retailer who really doesn’t have any apparel..he admits that he hates folding clothes..“and working with accessories and luggage  i’m learning a different side of the industry without having to hate the side that i actually love  if that makes sense.”.i asked him for some fashion tips given i have had some… constructive criticism at times. (hey  i’m always trying to learn.).“style is something you acquire  not something that you learn.” hmm  i hope i can learn something still!.so i asked him for a fashion tip for me/ men..alex instructs me  “don’t wear flip-flops in public. unless you’re going to a pool  a beach  or a gym locker room  don’t wear flip-flops.”.he adds  “hate when guys wear sneakers with suits. and then black shoes with a brown belt. never do that.” *phew* i haven’t committed any fashion faux pas recently..for me  i wanted some direct advice..“i say always just go with what feels good on your body. because at the end of the day  if you’re not confident in what you’re wearing  you’re not going to look good. always make sure you’re confident in what you’re wearing  and don’t really care about what other people think.”.if you could go back in time and change one thing  what would it be? at any point in time  what would you change? (thanks to bruce  stranger 70).“that’s really tough. i probably would’ve stayed at ohio state to finish my degree.” his degree was in early childhood education..“and probably not be working in retail if i had done that. probably stay and finish my original degree instead of transferring for a passion. and then  while working in that field go to classes for the passion. that’s probably what i would change.”.“definitely  i would’ve focused more and stuck with the smarter route instead of… go with my head and not with my heart.”.what would you like to ask tomorrow’s stranger?.“that is so tough.” he thinks. “just cut all the crap and go deep…” of course  if he wants to go deep. doesn’t have to..“where do you see yourself in 5 years? that’s a question i ask everyone. i feel like knowing someone’s future plans helps get to know them as a person now.”.after the handshake..it’s been a few hours  but i’m still thinking about what alex said about not pursuing his passion while in school  and instead  focus on the “rational” (or as he put it  “smarter route”). i think there’s a lot of commotion for people to follow their passions  and that’s indeed something i espouse. however  there’s also an element of diving into your passion without a safety net. the logic here is that you’re backed into a corner and have to make that passion/ business work. there’s no right or wrong answer here. instead  it’s just making that decision and executing. for alex  there is no reset button on college. he’s instead building his brand while doing what he needs to to live..i also appreciated alex sharing his earliest (/ fondest) memory with his father and how it coincided with the osu football game. when i think back to one of my fondest memories with my dad growing up  i think about how we would go to a local baseball batting cage about 8pm. i’d be done with my homework  and he’d be done with work. we’d drive about 15 minutes to the batting cages (grand slam in norcross)  and i would practice for about an hour. after then  we would to a fast-food restaurant (the varsity in norcross) and order big things of ice cream in waffle cones (i would get simple vanilla while he’d get mint chocolate chip). we’d sit in my dad’s (and later mine) ’88 4runner. we’d have so much ice cream that it’d start to melt  and he would show me to put the ice cream upside down in a cup so the ice cream wouldn’t drip everywhere. i’d then use a spoon to eat it. we’d sit there for about 30 minutes just eating. and i remember a cop walking up to our car sharing with us how much he loved his ’88 4runner  and how he had taken off the fiberglass top to drive it convertible-style and had considered getting a “bikini top” for it. i include some details (just a small fraction) because that’s how vivid that memory was for me  and how powerful it was. i imagine alex has a similar memory with his father at the game 16 years ago. stories like alex’s make me relive my own memories and recall so many great experiences and relationships..meet alex. no longer a stranger..november 26  2016 /0 comments/by strangerdlu.tags: artist  creativity  entrepreneur  family  sports  student.share this entry.share on facebook.share on twitter.share on google+.share on pinterest.share on linkedin.share on tumblr.share on vk.share on reddit.share by mail.http://100strangers100days.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/stranger-71-day-71-alex_2_cropped-and-scaled.jpg 1851 1280 strangerdlu http://100strangers100days.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/logo-light-blue-300x116.png strangerdlu2016-11-26 11:17:482016-11-30 07:17:51stranger 71  day 71 - meet alex  the ""apparel designer"".you might also like.stranger 87  day 87 - meet emily  the ""beginning of an adventure""	.stranger 90  day 90 - meet john  the ""real estate and investment guru""	.stranger 39  day 39 - meet megan  the ""planner and people gatherer""	.stranger 14  day 14 - meet sandrika  the ""happily animated""	.bonus round: stranger 101  day 101 - meet me  the ""doer""	.stranger 17  day 17 - meet jennifer  the ""empathetic nursing student""	.0 replies.leave a reply.want to join the discussion?.feel free to contribute!	.leave a reply cancel reply.your email address will not be published. required fields are marked *.comment.name *.email *.website.save my name  email  and website in this browser for the next time i comment..sign up for stranger stories!.archives.january 2017.december 2016.november 2016.october 2016.september 2016.tags.artist atlanta tech village books boston business cars comics creativity education emergence entrepreneur exercise family fashion film fire food friends fun gatherer hardship health medicine mentor military music new to atlanta persistence purpose relationship relationships religion sales school science sports starbucks stone mountain student teacher traveler volunteer writer yoga younger.© copyright - 100 strangers  100 days.twitter.instagram.stranger 70  day 70 – meet bruce  the “sarcastic” stranger 72  day 72 – meet toby  the “comic book enthusiastr....scroll to top."
