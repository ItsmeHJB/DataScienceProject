Typically a product of white privilege these folks prefer their own kind. They usually keep a minority friend around to help claim social consciousness despite having never lived anywhere with real diversity. They can often be heard talking to each other about how great, better, and less racist they are compared to everyone else.

      "The Big Switch - An event in American history that never happened, it was made up to say that the Democratic Party became racially enlightened and all the racist Democrats moved over to the Republican Party, which is false, the only Democrat who did that was Strom Thurmond, and even when he did that, he became less racist than he was when a Democrat as for every other racist Democrat they were lifelong Democrats, and so was every poor white racist. What did happen was an economic switch, when more industry came to the south, the south became more Republican, but as racism dramatically declined in the south, the south also became more Republican.\n",

      "AFFIRMATIVE ACTION - In America, Affirmative Action was a product of the Great Society policies of President Lyndon Baines Johnson. It was first codified into law under a series of Executive Orders (not approved by Congress, in other words), which stated that munitions manufacturers including private firms doing business with the federal government should \"take affirmative action\" in hiring minorities - at the time defined almost solely as African Americans.\n",
      " As the Vietnam War dragged on under President Richard Milhous Nixon, Affirmative Action became part of a wider government program to bribe inner city blacks to get with the program and support their government. Of course, Affirmative Action, welfare (started under FDR in the 1930s) and other government handouts did nothing to increase the love that black people had for the federal government.\n",
      " By 1978 liberal activism was under attack. President Jimmy Carter had expanded Johnson's liberal social programs to their ultimate extreme, and white, middle class Americans began to look toward the Republican Party and their rising star, Ronald Reagan, for new political direction. That same year, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against quotas for the first time in the landmark California Board of Regents vs. Allan Bakke decision. However, Affirmative Action was far from dead and buried.\n",
      " Today Affirmative Action remains rooted in American policy, although most Americans including many African-Americans find Affirmative Action outmoded for the much less racist atmosphere of the 21st Century.\n",
      " Inexplicably Affirmative Action still exists, even after the election of Barack Obama.\n",
